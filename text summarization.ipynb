            "During a recent episode of Divorce Court, a disgruntled man said the members of Wu-Tang Clan did something with his girlfriend - and it wasn't unleashing their famed Killa Beez. Nathan Sellers went on the show with his ex, Lia Palmquist, and accused her of sleeping with every member of the Wu-Tang Clan during one night as she partied with them at a hotel after a show. That would mean Palmquist had sex with the RZA, the GZA, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa, U-God, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon, Cappadonna and Method Man. The tenth member of the Wu, Ol' Dirty Bastard, is dead so he wasn't involved no matter what. Nathan Sellers (right) went on Divorce Court with Lia Palmquist (left) and said she slept with the Wu-Tang Clan . American rap group Wu-Tang Clan (L - R) Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa, Raekwon, RZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, GZA, U-God and Method Man pose for a April 1997 portrait in New York City, New York. ODB is no longer alive . Palmquist admitted to partying with the guys from the Wu, but denied that she did anything sexual with them . Palmquist told show host Judge Lynn Toler: 'This sounds ridiculous, but he accused me of sleeping with the entire Wu-Tang Clan.' Sellers quickly fired back: 'She did.' The accused woman went on to tell Judge Toler that she did hang with the Clan on their tour bus and stay at their hotel until 7am talking politics, but maintained she stayed faithful to Sellers. She said: 'Nothing inappropriate happened and let me just put on the record that Wu-Tang is nothing but gentleman. 'They treated me highly respectful. 'I would never cheat on him. 'I would never be a bust-down or a groupie in that type of situation.' Unfortunately her ex-boyfriend wasn't buying it and Sellers said: 'She gave Wu some tang.' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior'. Sellers wasn't buying anything that his ex-girlfriend had to say and told the judge: 'She gave Wu some tang' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed in the matter, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior' In March, the Wu-Tang Clan opened the silver box that held their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin . Sellers and Palmquist went on Divorce Court after being together for five years, according to the show's description of the episode. It read: 'The two met at a Halloween party where Lia was dressed as Lil Kim and Nathan was dressed as Hello Kitty. 'Lia says things were good for the first few years they dated until Nathan moved six hours away to attend school. 'Lia says Nathan then moved to San Francisco for a few months chasing his dreams of being a fashion designer, before moving back in with her again. 'Lia says her sex life with Nathan is non-existent right now. 'She says she wants a traditional family with kids, and she doesn’t think Nathan does.' Earlier this year, the Wu-Tang Clan opened the silver box that held their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin and sold the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. Under the terms of the sale, the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for a playing of the album. It was the first and last time any of the album was played before the year 2103.\n",

            "Demetrious Johnson retained his UFC flyweight champion title on Saturday night, controlling Kyoji Horiguchi for nearly the entire five-round bout before scoring the latest submission win in UFC history - tapping out his opponent with a second left. 'I didn't want to be stupid and get knocked out,' Johnson said. 'I had 25 minutes. I just took my time, and with 1 second left, I figured I better finish him.' Demetrious Johnson retained his UFC flyweight title with a win over Kyoji Horiguchi in Montreal . Johnson celebrates after a successful defence of his title at th Bell Centre in Canada on Saturday . The American secured a submission victory over Horiguchi in the latest UFC pay-per-view event . Horiguchi was dangerous in the opening round, as his blend of unorthodox, karate-based movements and impressive speed gave the champ some pause in the early going. But the Japanese contender was unable to truly capitalize on the opportunities, and it would cost him. Johnson (22-2-1) simply took over in the second round, showing the wide range of skills that have earned him recognition as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters. Constant pressure from the champ left Horiguchi (15-2) struggling to find any opportunity to attack. Instead, the challenger was constantly forced to try and prevent Johnson from taking his back, as they battled routinely against the fence and in the clinch. The American Johnson lands a right hand on his Japanese opponent during their bout in Montreal . Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson (right) beat Fabio Maldonado of Brazil to win his first bout since 2011 . It was one-way traffic until the final round, and the 23-year-old challenger was simply overwhelmed by the more experienced champ. Horiguchi tried to attack until the end, briefly threatening with a fifth-round triangle choke, but he was simply overwhelmed. While he was clearly ahead on the scorecards in the final seconds, Johnson turned up the volume, transitioned to an armbar and scored the submission win. Johnson successfully defended the title for the sixth time. In the co-main event, Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson (36-11) earned his first UFC win since 2011, scoring a unanimous decision over Brazilian slugger Fabio Maldonado (22-8).\n",

            "Muhammad Naviede, 60, (pictured outside the Old Bailey in 1995) was killed instantly in a plane crash . A banking fraudster with links to Cherie Blair was killed instantly in a plane crash minutes after he sent a text saying his aircraft was going down, an investigation has revealed. Muhammad Naviede, who was jailed in 1995 for nine years for a £45million fraud, died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire. The 60-year-old, whose daughter is a former X-Factor contestant, sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on August 20 last year saying: 'I'm in a plane out of control and it's going down.' An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the message was 'unusual' as the leased plane did not enter a spin until after it was sent. The experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the AAIB said would require 'considerable dexterity'. The report said: 'The pilot had accumulated considerable experience in a variety of aircraft in the years that he had been flying. He was familiar with the Piper Tomahawk aircraft and was in recent flying practice. 'It was suggested in his final text message that he had lost control of the aircraft, to such an extent that he did not expect to survive. 'However, after this message was sent, the aircraft continued in flight for more than two minutes, before entering a spin from which it did not recover.' Investigators found no fault with the aircraft and said weather conditions were unlikely to have caused the crash. Mr Naviede, of Regent's Park, London, had previously undertaken aerobatic training, meaning he 'would have recognised, and been able to recover from, a spin', according to the AAIB. The investigation also revealed the father-of-two had not booked a final destination for the fatal flight. Mr Naviede, whose personal wealth was once estimated to be £117million, was the former head of trade finance company Arrows, which collapsed owing more than £100 million to overseas banks and other creditors in 1991. He was the father of model and 2007 X-Factor contestant Raquelle Gracie, who was in girl band Hope, and had a record with Pharrell Williams. The girls initially auditioned for the fourth series as solo artists but judge Louis Walsh told them to re-audition as a band and they made it to the live shows where they came fifth. His Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire in August last year . The pilot had written a 148 character text within 25 seconds - something the Air Accident Investigation Branch said would require 'considerable dexterity especially in an aircraft that may have been out of control' Ms Gracie, who is married with an 18-month-old daughter, is now a yoga teacher and continues to sing after previously hosting an online news and gossip series on website Dipdive, created by will.i.am. His brother was the former Government race advisor Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004. In 1995, a jury at the Old Bailey convicted him of seven charges of fraudulent trading, obtaining property and services by deception and making false statements to obtain bank facilities. On the day of the crash, Mr Naviede had flown the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk from Elstree, Hertfordshire, to Turweston Aerodrome before heading on to White Waltham airfield near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He was then due to return to Elstree, but at 4.55pm Mr Naviede telephoned the aerodrome to say he would not be returning that day and did not book an alternative destination. The plane took off from White Waltham shortly after 5pm, heading north, and when he was just south of Buckingham, he began to fly in a circle for almost an hour at between 2,500ft and 4,700ft. His daughter Raquelle Gracie (far right) came fifth in the 2007 series of the X Factor with girl band Hope . It was at this time he made a number of calls on his mobile telephone and at 6.31pm he unsuccessfully tried to call the relative who he then sent the final text to. Investigators suggested that two minutes later he still had 'at least control of lateral flight'. The aircraft then turned to the left as the pilot sent out a 'Mayday' distress call, saying: 'Lost control of the aircraft and it's gone into a spin.' Mr Naviede then confirmed his location to the controller before saying: 'I can't control it.' Mr Naviede's brother was former Government race advisor, Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004 . The AAIB report said: 'It was apparent, from the witness accounts and the on-site evidence, that the aircraft had entered a spin from which it did not recover. 'The time elapsed during the pilot's final radio transmissions, together with the rate of descent deduced from the NASA videos, suggested that the spin was likely to have started from a minimum height of 2,500ft, and probably higher.' The report also highlighted strange aspects of Mr Naviede's behaviour on the day, although people who spoke to him said he appeared 'chatty, friendly and relaxed'. Investigators wrote: 'There were a number of events which took place in the course of the afternoon which represented unusual actions on the part of the pilot. 'It appears the pilot made a change of intended destination prior to leaving White Waltham. 'Having booked out for Elstree he subsequently called them to advise he would not be returning there. He did not book out to any other destination. 'After departing White Waltham and flying north for about half an hour, he flew in a large circular pattern for almost an hour. 'Although somewhat unusual, this may be explained by the need to re-charge the aircraft battery.' Mr Naviede, who had more than 3,000 hours of flying experience, died instantly in the crash and a post-mortem examination carried out on his body revealed he died as a result of multiple injuries. A date has not been set for an inquest but it is likely to take place in May with a jury.\n",

            "(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport. Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage . CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.\n",

            "Smartly dressed in a bowler hat and waistcoat, these civilians may look like respectable members of society in Edwardian England. In fact, they were the drunkards banned from every boozer in Birmingham for a string of crimes including drink-driving a steam engine, riding a horse while drunk and being intoxicated to the point of 'complete incompetence'. They were all placed on the 1904 blacklist after four convictions under the Inebriates Act of 1898. The list was then sent to landlords who were not allowed to sell them alcohol. Scroll down for video . Boozy: Kitted out in a bowler hat and waistcoat, he may appear to be a right-thinking member of Edwardian England, but Matthew Moran was banned from every pub in Birmingham at the turn of the century . Black listed: Alice Tatlow was also banned from every Birmingham boozer for being 'drunk and disorderly'; publicans were told they could recognise her by a tattoo of the Prince of Wales's feathers . Barred: 46-year-old Mary Bayliss was one of the many respectable-looking women barred from drinking in Birmingham after being found drunk and disorderly . On the blacklist, each drunkard’s entry includes photographs, their name, alias, residence, employment, physical description, distinguishing marks, nature of conviction and the sentence received for booze-related crimes. Offenders who were caught drunk and disorderly were ordered to work up to 21 days of 'hard labour' in comparison to today's fixed penalty or fine. They form part of the UK Midlands Collection, which covers a 400 year period and contains more than 21 million records detailing the good, the bad and the famous who have shaped the history of the city. Unearthed by Ancestry, the world's largest online family history resource, the records are available for all to see. Ladette: Elizabeth Thompson was a 29-year-old prostitute when she was arrested for drunkenness and sentenced to two weeks' hard labour . Rowdy: Charwoman Susannah Booton was arrested for drunken behaviour in February 1906 . Criminal: Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their nose and face; Annie Hodgkins was said to have a 'fresh complexion' despite being sentenced to three weeks' hard labour . Poster: Unemployed Kate Kibble, another woman convicted of being drunk and disorderly, was described as having a 'broad' build, as well as losing her right eye and having 'both little fingers crooked' Some of the bizarre offences committed by past Birmingham residents include theft of a dead duck and riding a horse while drunk. Nearly 10,000 Edwardian felons are listed in the UK Midlands criminal registers providing fascinating insight into the murky underworld of Birmingham's metropolis more than a century ago. Among those on the blacklist are Henry Bonus, 40, who was sentenced to a year's hard labour and three months' police supervision after stealing eight pounds of ham. Elsewhere, 18-year-old William Handley was sentenced to eight months' hard labour and one-year's police supervision for stealing a 'dead duck' and a teapot. Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute, before being banned from pubs for being drunk and disorderly . Haggard: Just 38, Eliza Fallon looked a lot older than her years when she was arrested for drunkenness . Distinctive: Sarah Evans, left, and Ellen Heaton, right, could be recognised by their scars, according to the Birmingham archives . Records reveal how offenders came from a variety of backgrounds, such as metal cutters, grease merchants, labourers and hawkers. Many had aliases - suggesting criminal careers - while others had scars or physical handicaps, ranging from Kate Kibble's one eye to cut marks on faces, broken noses and missing fingers. Some, however, lived perfectly respectable lives - until they walked through the door of their local watering hole. It shows how those living in Edwardian England were just as likely to get half-cut and troublesome on a night out as boozy Brits in today's binge drinking culture.\n",

            "Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain. 'I think John Kerry tried to come back and sell a bill of goods, hoping maybe that the Iranians wouldn’t say much about it,' the Republican lawmaker told radio host Hugh Hewitt during his Thursday program. McCain, responding to the supreme leader of Iran's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way.' Launching a rare attack from his official White House Twitter account, President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest in turn said it was 'naïve and reckless' for McCain 'to believe every word of the Supreme Leader's political speech.' 'He shouldn't,' Earnest added. And the president's deputy national security adviser told reporters traveling with the administration abroad that it's 'very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased.' Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain . Kerry, is flanked here by President Barack Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice at the bilateral meeting between President Obama and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela today in Panama City, Panama. The Obama administration is in Panama to attend the VII Summit of the Americas . 'The fact of the matter is, we have framework,' Rhodes said, according to the Associate Press. 'The president has said if the details don't bear out, we won't have a deal.' Obama, Kerry, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other members of the president's kitchen cabinet are in Panama for the Summit of the Americas. Backed into a corner by reporters, the White House on Monday indicated that negotiators left Switzerland last week without coming to an agreement about the pace at which sanctions would be removed. The administration had stated in a fact sheet that nuclear-related sanctions would be 'suspended' if Iran complied with the terms of the deal. The president said in a live statement they would be 'phased' out over time. The framework, however, he said would remain in place so sanctions could be snapped back into place if need be. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, immediately cast a cloud over the United State's assertions, pointing out that the statement released by the United States' negotiating partners made no reference to either the gradual lifting of sanctions. Zarif indicated that his country was under the interpretation was that sanctions would be 'terminated.' Asked the next day about Zarif's claims, the lead spokeswoman for the State Department shrugged them off and said she wasn't too concerned with how Iranian leaders sold the deal in their own country. Barraged with questions at his Monday briefing about who was lying - the U.S. or Iran - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute's potential for derailing a written agreement. Khamenei reaffirmed on Thursday his country's vow not to sign an agreement unless negotiators kowtow to Iran's demands and promise the 'instant annulment of all sanction,' according to a translation. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani similarly said, 'We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' Khamenei further stated Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn’t allowed,' he said on Twitter. Speaking to reporters in Panama today, Rhodes also dismissed Iranian officials' rhetoric about the agreement as spin. 'They have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal,' he said. 'The test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized is not a comment on any given day by an Iranian leader, the test will be if by the end of June we have a document.' Responding to the supreme leader of Iran's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' McCain, above, said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way' McCain ripped into former colleague Kerry on Hewitt's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with Iran. 'It’s probably in black and white that the Ayatollah is probably right,' McCain said. 'John Kerry is delusional.' Continuing, the Arizona senator said, 'I think you’re going to find out that they had never agreed to the things that John Kerry claimed that they had.' 'So in a way, I can’t blame the Ayatollah, because I don’t think they ever agreed to it.' Republican Senator Mark Kirk on Thursday said, 'It’s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement. 'At best, Iran agreed to disagree with the United States on key nuclear weapons-related issues and to continue talks,' the Illinois lawmaker said. McCain told Hewitt Kerry's behavior 'reveals that a number of things' about his 'negotiating capabilities and also his candor with the American people.' He also said he believes Senate Republicans are 'extremely close' to winning enough Democrats' support to push through a veto-proof bill giving Congress the power to review the formal deal with Iran that is scheduled to materialize by June 30. Khamenei further stated that Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring' Even with out that legislation, McCain claimed that the Senate has the Constitutional authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty. Obama should 'read the Constitution of the United States,' McCain said. This is clearly a treaty.' And even if the president 'disregards the Constitution' McCain said - 'which he certainly did with executive orders concerning immigration' - Congress should have a say in an issue of this scale. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Armed Services Committee who is exploring a presidential run, said in a statement Friday afternoon that 'the Ayatollah and President Obama appear to be talking about two separate agreements. 'Unfortunately, I can’t say I’m surprised,' he added. 'President Obama wants a deal way too badly, and his Administration has been trying to sell a deal which may not actually exist.' Graham said the Obama administration should tell Iran 'in no uncertain terms – that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties, sanctions relief will not be immediate.' 'Any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until Iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program.' Drawing on Khamenei's comment about supervision, Graham said he would 'never' lend his support to a deal that doesn't allow for inspections 'anytime and anywhere.' With 'Iran’s history of cheating,' he said, 'it would be incredibly dangerous not to require Iran to abide by an ‘anytime-anywhere’ inspections regime.'\n",

            "We have had cereal cafes, a porridge pop-up and a toastie restaurant so it should come as no surprise that London is about to get yet another single-item menu eaterie. The latest to open in the capital this week is the Oshun Café, which will serve £6 bowls of Brazilian superfood acai berries. The sparse menu offers four variations of berry bowls, served with different toppings and fruit accompaniments. The Native Acai Berry Bowl is topped with bananas, granola, raisin and honey . Oshun Kong (left) made with coriander, ginger, lemongrass and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Courgette, lime, sour cherries and strawberries in the Oshun Tang (right) The fruit bowls include Oshun Native made with acaí pulp, banana and honey; The Oshun Tang made with courgette, lime, sour cherries and acai pulp; the Oshun Kong featuring acaí pulp, banana, lemongrass, ginger, coriander and honey; and the Oshun Maya with acaí pulp, raw cacao, cinnamon, orange and avocado. Liane Holey, founder of the cafe said: ‘Brazil’s streets are filled with vendors blending acaí pulp with fresh bananas and then topped with honey and granola to create an innocuously addictive berry bowl. ‘Oshun Cafe wants the UK to celebrate this way of eating acaí, not as powder, dried supplements or in smoothies and pasteurised juices which have significantly smaller amounts of Açaí and preserved nutrients.” The acaí berry is a rich purple fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, the small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazonian people. The Acai Berry Bowl Cafe will serve four types of berry bowls. The cafe is open from seven days a week . Oshun Maya with cinnamon, raw cacao, orange and avocado with nested popcorn . The berries taste like blueberries and dark chocolate, with a distinctly earthy aftertaste. They are a favourite of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Oprah Winfrey and Matthew McConaughey. Due to their high level of antioxidants the berries are considered a superfood.They also contain high levels of manganese and Omega and are renowned for their weight loss qualities. Oshun Native - acaí pulp, banana and honey. Oshun Tang: courgette, lime, sour cherries and acai pulp . Oshun Kong: banana, lemongrass, ginger, coriander and honey. Oshun Maya: acai berries, raw cacao, cinnamon, orange and avocado . Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body. 'It’s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.' The large seed from each berry is removed and the remaining Açaí pulp (along with its nutrients) is frozen within 24 hours of being harvested, due to the fresh berry’s short lifespan. In Brazil, acai berry bowls are eaten around the clock. Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open in Soho, London in May . Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open its doors in May. The menu will offer a variety of sandwiches, from the classic grilled cheese which will set you back £4.50 to more upmarket fillings such as slow-cooked lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens. Nik Williamson of The Porridge Cafe . The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts . The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses. Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe . The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal. The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London. Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his pop-up going for just four weeks.

Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened  in January is the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin . But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or London. 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said. Moo’d, opened by best friends Zoe Blogg and Jen Gibb in Leeds in February this year, offers 100 different cereals as well as ‘cocktails’ consisting of mixed varieties of different brands. Not wanting to be left behind, two rivals are racing to become Manchester's first cereal cafe. Black Milk Cereal Dive has confirmed it will open in Afflecks Palace this month, and according to Twitter, Cereal Central MCR is 'coming soon.' The acai berry is a rich purple palm fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, these small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazon people. The berries are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc. The fruit perishes quickly after being picked, so to help preserve its goodness it is often made into acai berry juice, supplements or powder, which is often whizzed into a smoothie. According to some sites selling acai products, the berry's fibre and essential fatty acid content contribute to its ability to burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly, cut down on cravings, and boost metabolism.\n",

Sportsmail asks some of the managers in and among the dog fight what they feel is required for them to avoid the drop this season. Question: 'What will it take for your club to stay in the Premier League?' CHRIS RAMSEY (QPR) 'If we win three games I think we will stay up. It might take less. I'm not saying that's the definitive amount - but we really need to start winning, starting with this weekend. To do that, we need to concentrate right to the end and make sure that our performances stay similar with a bit more defensive resilience.' QPR manager Chris Ramsey (centre) feels they will avoid relegation if they win three more league games . TIM SHERWOOD (Aston Villa) 'I don't know how many points it will take. We've done alright. Nothing's been achieved yet. I'm a new voice and given them a lot of belief and confidence that they are better than what they were showing. They have managed to score a few more goals and have real belief they can go to places and win. Something was probably a little bit missing previously. I want to make sure that I don't take my foot off pedal. I'll make sure the players don't.' Tim Sherwood (left) believes his appointment at Aston Villa has given them a lot of belief and confidence .

If it applies a bit more pressure on other sides around us, fine also. But as far as I'm concerned it's about making sure we're back to business when we play Burnley.

            "Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is unsure whether a planned boycott by Newcastle fans will prove a help or hindrance to his side this weekend. This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle . Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park . It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out . The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood. 'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.' Pochettino will come up against his countryman Jonas Guiterrez following his recovery from cancer . This weekend's match against Newcastle will also see Pochettino come up against a countryman who has made many a headline of late. Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many. 'I am very happy for him,' Pochettino said. 'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football. 'This is real life. Sometimes we worry about a lot of things and results, but this is real life when you have the problems that he has. 'For me, I am very happy to see him come back to football.'\n",

            "A skier in Switzerland proved that his dog is certainly his best friend when he brought it along to a snowy slope for a day of skiing. Videoed descending the crisp ski runs of the small resort of Minschuns in Val Müstair, Adrian Schaffner is initially featured ascending the mountain on a button lift. Perched on his shoulders looking entirely at ease is his dog Sintha – an Appenzeller mix according to the owner, who noted alongside the upload of the original video that he only knows the breed of the dog's mother. The dog named  Sintha appears to be entirely at ease as it sits across its owners shoulders . Once at the top, Mr Schaffner points his skis down the mountain and takes off at speed with the dog remaining calmly sat on his back. The dog appears to be enjoying the sensation of speed as it points its face into the wind and the camera angle changes to show the skier’s descent. After a long ski to the bottom, Mr Schaffner comes to a stop and the dog jumps from his shoulders and onto the ground. Mr Schaffner points his skis down the mountain and begins skiing at speed and the dog remains calmly sat on his back . The dog appears to be enjoying the sensation of speed and points its face into the wind . The skier smiles at the camera as the excited dog begins barking and running off in the snow. The video concludes with the dog – who obviously loves snow – chasing after some more skiers as they make their way down another section of mountain. Discussing the video, Mr Schaffner wrote: ‘She grew up on a farm in the mountains pretty wild and more or less without any supervision. Mr Schaffner said the dog is used to being held because she spent a lot of time being carried after an accident . After a long ski to the bottom, Mr Schaffner comes to a stop and the dog jumps from his shoulders and onto the ground . ‘And she had severe problems with walking because of an accident with a biker when she was about five-weeks-old. She almost died. ‘When we adopted her at the age of about 13 weeks, we had to carry her around. So she was used to it from the beginning. ‘After some months her injuries completely healed – but we kept trying to prevent long walks in her first year – the doctor advised so. ‘That time I started to carry her on my back. That's why she is so comfortable with it.’ The dog jumps from its owners back and begins barking and running in the snow before chasing after other skiers . Mr Schaffner recorded the video of himself and his dog at the small skiing resort of Minschuns in Val Müstair .\n",

            "After Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus announced that it will no longer have elephants in the show starting in 2018, the organization gave a rare tour of the facility where the elephants will retire. Once the animals are done in the ring, they'll be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida. Some of the Asian Elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center, while other will be used for breeding. Scroll down for video . All elephants will be phased out of the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus performance by 2018 . Once they retire from performing, elephants will be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida . Ringling spokeswoman Melinda Hartline told FOX Tampa Bay that the center is 'all about preserving the Asian Elephant'. Elephants born in the center can be sold to zoos or other breeding programs. This will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population. The population of animal has decreased to between 25,000 and 32,000 from it's 100,000 population over the last century. Poaching and habitat destruction are among the reasons for the decline. Twenty people work at the center to feed, care for and manage the animals, and over the next three years Ringling will determine if more staff or additional facilities are needed. Despite having what seems to be ideal living conditions, Ringling ties some elephants by the leg overnight, something animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are disappointed by. Some elephants will live out the rest of their lives in the conservation center, while others will be use for breeding . A spokesman for the center said that the organization's goal is to conserve the Asian Elephant, an animal who has seen massive population decline over the last century . Much of the population decline - which has gone down from 100,000 to between 25,000 and 32,000 - has been caused by poaching and habitat destruction . 'Zoos don't chain elephants and the American Veterinary Medical Association advises against it' Delciana Windners, PETA general counsel, told FOX. The animal-rights organizations also urge the company to take the animals off the road sooner. Just days before announcing that the elephants would be taken out of the ring, PETA prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis. TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read. Animal rights groups, including PETA, have said that Ringling Brothers should take elephants out of their shows before 2018 . PETA released information earlier this year stating that at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis .\n",

            "On trial: Former Ukip MEP Ashley Mote (pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today) is accused of a string of fraud-related offences . A former Ukip MEP fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in European Parliament expenses - using some of it to fund his domestic court battles, a court heard today. Ashley Mote, 79, of Binsted, Hampshire, is accused of a string of fraud-related offences including acquiring criminal property and obtaining a money transfer by deception. Some of the money he allegedly made from the fraud went towards funding various legal costs he had built up as a result of being prosecuted in the UK for benefit fraud offences, a jury at London's Southwark Crown Court was told. He denies 11 offences alleged to have taken place between November 2004 and July 2010. Jonathan Davies, prosecuting, said that as an MEP, Mote could claim expenses, including a Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, or Secretarial Allowance, to help fund his work. Mr Davies said: ‘What the prosecution say happened between 2004 and 2009, when Mr Mote ceased to be an MEP, is that he abused that allowance by submitting false claims for payment for work which he said to the European Parliament had been done by organisations working on his behalf.’ Jurors heard that two of the organisations had previously campaigned against UK membership of the European Union. They were the Better Off Out Fund (Boof), and Direct Action Resistance To Tyranny (Dartt). However, it is alleged that neither of these companies conducted any work for Mote, who made claims of £16,000 against Boof, and £54,000 to Dartt. ‘They were simply used as a front to perpetrate, carry out fraud and to receive monies from the European Parliament,’ said Mr Davies. European Parliament in Brussels: Prosecutors claim Mote was 'using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud' Mote is also said to have falsely claimed £5,000 a month for work he claimed had been carried out by Estonia based company Icos (Information Centrum Owned State). It is alleged that he even set up a Danish bank account under the similar name of ‘Information Centrim OS’ for funds from the European Parliament to be paid into, ‘dishonestly obtaining’ approximately €355,000. Giving details of Mote carrying out fraud to fund his rising legal bills, Mr Davies said: ‘He asked for payments to be made to the firm of solicitors on the basis that they were providing him with advice in relation to his duties as an MEP. ‘In fact the money was being used to fund a number of criminal and civil proceedings related to Mr Mote's prosecution for benefit fraud offences, and indeed some unrelated civil proceedings. ‘Basically we say he was using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud.’ Mr Davies continued: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud committed over several years during which Mr Mote made a number of false representations and produced a number of false documents in order to deceive the European Parliament into believing that significant amounts of work were being done on his behalf, relating to his work as an MEP. Pleading not guilty: Mote (pictured again today) allegedly fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in expenses . ‘In total he dishonestly obtained approximately €355,000 and £184,000 of allowances to which he was not entitled. It's not quite half a million pounds, but it's not far short.’ Jurors heard that while MEPs were allowed to make certain legitimate claims for expenses from the European Parliament, they were not supposed to use this money to enrich themselves. Between 2004, when he was elected MEP and 2009, Mote claimed a total of £750,000 in Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity. Mote was elected a Ukip MEP for South East England in 2004, but shortly before he actually took up his seat was thrown out of Nigel Farage's party because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud. However, he sat as an independent MEP until 2009, when he decided not to stand for election. The court heard that in April 2004 Mote's case for alleged income support, council tax and housing benefit fraud was sent to crown court to be dealt with, and he was elected as an MEP two months later. Elected as MEP: Mote (pictured in 2006) was thrown out of Ukip because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud . But he made an application to the court saying that the criminal proceedings against him were a breach of his rights to free movement, as his bail conditions meant he could not travel freely to Europe. The courts agreed with this and proceedings against Mote were stayed, prompting the prosecution to make an application to the Attorney General to review the matter. Jurors heard that in light of this, Mote wrote to the manager of European Parliament allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this. He wrote: ‘I have to fund myself in the legal affairs committee against an attempt by the British government to unseat me as an MEP. This is going to incur legal costs.’ However, Mr Davies told the court that Mote did not disclose that he was being prosecuted for fraud. He said: ‘What Mr Mote doesn't say is something along the lines of “I am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an MEP”.’ Jurors heard that the Attorney General overturned the decision and Mote was prosecuted and convicted of benefit fraud in August 2007. Mote denies four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property and concealing criminal property. The trial resumes at 10am tomorrow when the opening will continue. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

            "A mayoral candidate has bungee jumped from a bridge where his ancestor plummeted 160ft to his death for a drunken bet worth just a sixpence. Dave Roberts, who is in the running to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, followed in his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister's footsteps by leaping off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees. However, instead of falling to his death like his relative did more than 100 years ago - Mr Roberts survived the jump which he carried out for a children's charity. Dave Roberts, who hopes to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, has bungee jumped off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees 100 years after his ancestor jumped to his death for a bet worth just a sixpence . Mr Roberts, a 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, said 'Daniel, this one's for you' as he jumped off the bridge - in reference to his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister who died after leaping off the bridge in 1913 . The 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, from Marton, Middlesbrough, said: 'I thought it was going to be sheer terror, but I actually really enjoyed it. 'I had a good moment just before the jump. The guy was saying, I am going to count to three, and then you are going to jump. 'I said, I need to speak to my relative. I said: \"Daniel, this one's for you. I am going to collect your winnings\". 'I screamed like a child as I was going down, but thoroughly enjoyed it.' Mr McAllister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in Port Clarence in a bet worth a sixpence. He died on May 4, 1913 at the age of 30. Newspaper articles from 1913 about Mr McAllister's death (pictured) tell how he 'dived to his death' and drowned following an 'amazing act of bravado' The cause of death was listed as: 'Shock and suffocation from drowning through jumping from the Transporter Bridge in a spirit of bravado whilst under the influence of drink.' Father-of-two Mr Roberts, who grew up listening to stories about his ancestor, managed to track down Mr McAllister's death certificate, which listed him as a general labourer of Washington Street in Middlesbrough. Mr Roberts, who was handed a sixpence and a beer after his jump this week, said: 'A century after Daniel was killed, and in a bid to exorcise the ghost of my ancestor, I decided I would have a go at the jump as well. 'But I wanted to do it as a charity event, and make sure I was safely attached to a bungee rope! 'The Daniel McAllister story has been in the family for over a century. 'No one really believed it to be true as all attempts to link it to the 1913 bridge jump had failed due to searching the wrong line of the family tree. 'Then we found a 1899 marriage certificate of Daniel's sister Emily, which opened a new route and this finally provided the link we needed.' Mr Roberts, who lives with his wife Francesca, 45, and children Kari, 14, and Luke 12, is running for mayor having moved back to England from a job in Singapore 18 months ago where he was vice president of business development for Fox TV. He said: 'This was all fun and games but I am a serious mayoral candidate for the town who has a great sense of humour and I'll be making a lot of serious points in the run-up to the election as I am a Middlesbrough lad who cares deeply about his town. 'Normally town mayors get set for the high jump after their term in office, this one got out of the way before the hard work starts.' He asked Teesside residents to stump up £2.50 - roughly what a sixpence would be worth today - to support him and raise money for the MFC Foundation which helps children in need.

            "(CNN)The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but \"inadvertently\" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. \"It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,\" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an \"excusable homicide.\" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. \"We're holding up all right at this point,\" Andre Harris said. \"We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation.\" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. \"However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,\" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.\n",

            "Patterns appearing on both the very large and very small scale are rare in nature. But researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin, and the mysterious fairy circles in Namibia. While the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random, as if the landscape is marked with freckles, the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells. Researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert. The illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells, and the one on the right plots fairy circles, which are also arranged in polygons . ‘It's a completely amazing, strange match,’ said Professor Robert Sinclair, head of the Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan. Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter (three metres to 20 metres) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon, or big freckles. Several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings, and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass, zebras rolling in circles, competition for resources, hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and even aliens. Desert fairy circles (pictured) are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because it is now known how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon, or big freckles . Now, Professor Sinclair and Haozhe Zhang believe they have identified a small, but vital, piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells. The duo compared the number of 'neighbours' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells, according to the study published in Ecological Complexity. They used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls. The majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six 'neighbours', and similar percentages of other neighbours (shown in this graph) The computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle. Another group of researchers had calculated skin cell neighbours in a similar way several years ago, which was used as a comparison. The experts found that the results were almost identical, in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours. And the percentage of fairy circles with four, five, six, seven, eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells. ‘I didn't expect it to be so close,’ Professor Sinclair said. ‘We spent a lot of time checking because it really looked too close to believe.’ Mr Zhang, a PhD student at Iowa State University who was previously at OISTsaid that future mathematical models designed to explain how fairy rings are made should incorporate the results of this study. The researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space. Professor Sinclair said: ‘It is still difficult to say why exactly they are similar, but the fact that they are similar is already very important. ‘This is suggesting there may be such types of patterns that cover really different size scales.’ Huge swathes of grassland in Namibia is covered with mysterious vegetation-free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades. While a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites, research last May claimed they are the result of resource competition for water among plants. German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are ‘remarkably regular’ in their distribution, which made them question the termite theory. Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. Last year, German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles (pictured in the Marienfluss Valley) and found that they are 'remarkably regular' in their distribution. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . The genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed. Their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones at the border of grassland and desert regions, according to the study published in the journal Ecography, where there is intense resource-competition for water. Dr Getzin's team was joined by experts from Göttingen in Germany, Italy and Israel who studied aerial images of the circles in north west Namibia to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape. Using statistical methods, they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas. ‘The occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual. There must be particularly strong regulating forces at work,’ Dr Getzin said. He believes it is the local resource-competition among plants and vegetation, in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water. ‘A similar process of resource-competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self-organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns,’ the study says. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia.\n",

            "Detectives probing the murders of a Playboy bunny and a 16-year-old schoolgirl 40 years ago have offered a £40,000 reward in a bid to bring their killer to justice. Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of 18 March 1975. Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was  attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends. She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later. Eve Stratford, 22, a Playboy bunny, was stabbed between eight and 12 times when she was murdered on the evening of 18 March 1975 . Both murders were linked in July 2006 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. It appears the motive was sexual - Lynne had been raped, and it is likely Eve had also been raped although detectives haven't been able to rule out consensual sex. The reward was posted last night as detectives appealed for information, which could lead to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible, on BBC's Crimewatch show. Lynne's mother, Margaret Weedon, described the murder 40 years ago as a 'true life sentence' for the family. Lynne Weedon (right) was beaten over the head with a blunt object. Detectives believes Lynda Farrow (left), who was knifed to death in 1979, was also a victim of the same killer . She said: 'We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. 'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like. 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence. 'The hurt eases but the pain still sits deep somewhere inside. There are so many questions. So many thoughts. So much heartache. 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.' Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from Scotland Yard  said he was hopeful the killer had let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend or even a cellmate or medical professional. He said it is likely the suspect for both murders is now in his 60s or 70s. The glamour model was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times . Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead . Mr McHugh said detectives are keeping an open mind but have previously said it is possible the killer knew his victims, particularly Eve who had a huge circle of friends and acquaintances. He added: 'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. 18 March 1975: Playboy bunny Eve Stratford found  with her throat slashed at her home. 3 September 1975: Lynne Weedon, 16, was attacked and raped in an alleyway  at 11pm. 10 September 1975: Schoolgirl died in hospital from her injuries. July 2006: Murders linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims. March 2015: Police launched fresh appeal on the 40th anniversary of their deaths. April 2015: Detectives offer £40,000 reward for information about killings. 'It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.' Mr McHugh appealed in particular to mental health professionals and prison officers who may have received disclosures from a patient or prisoner. Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. Miss Stratford worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966. She was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body. Miss Stratford (left) worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966 . This map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked . She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body. She was last seen walking alone near her home in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in March. Later that year Lynne was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. She was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead. A school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she died a week later.

            "Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about his daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles on Saturday night and admitted 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it.' In an emotional outburst during a concert Bobby appeared close to tears as he referenced his daughter's ongoing battle for her life.​ . ​The former husband of Whitney Houston looked tired and grief stricken at times during his performance, his first public appearance since Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles on Saturday night and admitted: 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it' The one-time boy band star shied away from talking in detail about his daughter but instead admitted these were 'rough times.' However, in an odd moment during his 45-minute set, he took time out to promote his kine of BBQ sauces. Bobby performed a set of his old hits for 4,000 fans at the Soul Food Festival ​in downtown Los Angeles ​on Saturday after months staying by his daughter Bobbi Kristina's side. Unresponsive: On January 31, Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub. She's been in a coma ever since . The 46-year-old was given the biggest cheer of the night as he took to the stage to play hits like Don't Be Cruel and ​On Our Own. ​After his drawn-out introduction Bobby, looking tired from performing dance moves, choked up as he said: 'I must ​tell y'all. This feels really, ​really really good. 'I want to thank all of y'all for coming out tonight​ to support me and my family. ​'Rough times are rough times, hard times are hard times I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with it.' ​Panting and sounding frustrated: '​There is only one thing I ask of you all tonight and that is enjoy yourselves.' Smiling he added: 'Don't be cruel, come on,' referring to one of his biggest hits​ the 80s. ​After a few other tunes, Bobby needed a break from the stage to rest while his boyband performed a number. Bobby needed a towel to wipe his face and often looked out of breath as he relived dance moves from his glory days. Later he was a little less emotional as fans cheered his performances of hits like Roni and Rock Witcha. Broke his silence: The former boy bander's appearance was booked before Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. It was also Brown's first time discussing the matter in public . Had a booth: Brown told the LA crowd, 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff to my new album to my new Edition to Heads Of States and I have been working on my food line; actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth' Looking toward his stand where his Bobby Brown BBQ cooking tent was set up at the festival, he told the crowd: 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff, to my new album, to my new Edition to Heads Of States, and I have been working on my food line. Actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth. ​'​I will over there in a little bit​ later, if you want to buy some barb​e​cue sauce, seasonings, chicken and a couple of sausages. I don'​t know what my wife is cooking ​- whatever it, is is good. You have got to get the season​ing​, because the seasoning is off the chain, I must let you know.' ​Bobby then asked a bandmate to talk about another brand, but fired back: 'Mine is much better, low in sodium content​, low in salt for us folk if, you understand what I ​am saying. ​'So I made this for us.' Wiping away sweat from his face, he added: 'I ain't done with it yet. I got marinades and all kind of s*** coming out.' He then corrected himself: 'Excuse my French baby girl. I didn't mean to curse in front of you. And ladies too.' He then introduced his new ​R&B​ boy band band 'who can saanng.' 'You just listen and tell me if you like it.' Back to work: Brown's pregnant wife Alicia Etheredge was also at the food festival, selling Bobby Brown's BBQ sauce . Timing: The singer and barbecue entrepreneur was committed to the event before his daughter was hospitalized. He's also slated for a tour of Australia . ​Bobby's appearance marks his first time away from Bobbi in months. He had been scheduled to make the appearance before his daughter's accident. Bobbi remains hospitalized and in a coma after being found unconscious and face-down in a bathtub on January 31. The Soul Food Festival is among a string of appearances Bobby is contractually obligated to fulfill/ The singer is also scheduled to leave daughter Bobbi to tour in Australia. Even though he doesn't want to go, the promoters are holding the distraught father to his contractual obligation, TMZ reports. Bobbi Kristina remains on life support in a long-term care center in Atlanta, Georgia, after being treated at the city's Emory University Hospital where the ex-husband of Whitney Houston visits her regularly. Reportedly Bobby has the final say as to whether the young woman's support system is turned off. ​At the Festival 90s rap act Salt'N'Pepa had the crowd on their feet with their performance of Push It.\n",

Ice cream vendor Katy Alston, 47, known as Mrs Whippy to her customers in the Sussex towns of Bognor Regis and Chichester, said the good weather has sent ice cream sales through the roof. She said: 'We have had a nice warm April and it has been absolutely amazing for sales. 'In April we usually potter around and find our feet, but this year it has been really busy. We did an event last week at Chichester University and sold out of ice creams in 40 minutes. It was just incredible - and it's down to the weather. 'Everybody says people eat ice cream all year round whatever the weather, but they don't. Children want to but adults won't let them. 'We have had our best April ever and I have been in business for 11 years. I would say our turnover for April has trebled.' Ms Alston, who runs the business with her daughter Georgia, 23, who is known as Little Miss Whippy, said the traditional 99s, and lemonade and cherry brandy ice lollies are her biggest sellers. The Met Office said most of Britain, including these three young women in Green Park, basked in sunshine today and will continue to enjoy good weather until Wednesday .

            "A celebrated Texas-born hunter was crushed to death by a baby elephant in Zimbabwe as he tried to measure its ivory tusks for an American client. Ian Gibson, 55, was a lauded figure among U.S. safari enthusiasts, who would commission him to slaughter prized animals near his home in South Africa. On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.\n",

            "Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which includes the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, as well as honouring Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. The seven-year-old came across the fossils at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile when he and his sister, Macarena were looking for decorative stones. They were playing at the site because their geologist parents, Manuel Suarez and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes mountain range. Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. However, more than a dozen specimens have now been excavated, including four skeletons, which demonstrate that the dinosaur combined a variety of unique anatomical traits. The dinosaur has been likened to a platypus, which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom, because it's one of very few mammal to lay eggs, has venomous spurs and a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver, as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck, among other idiosyncrasies. Most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey, but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of Chilesaurus was around 10 feet (three metres) long, according to Chilean and Argentinian palaeontologists from institutions including the University of Birmingham who have studied the skeletons. Unusual: Fossils dating from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups, including relatively short arms, a long neck, small head and leaf-shaped teeth (pictured) Bizarre: Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The dinosaur itself, has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance (illustrated) Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics. The Late Jurassic dinosaur lived 145 million years ago. It has a small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus, but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws, like the Velociraptor, for example. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon. It has leaf-shaped teeth, similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs. Most unusually, the animal was a vegetarian, despite belonging the theopod family of dinosaurs, which were mostly fierce meat eaters. The dinosaur ranged in size from as small as a turkey to 10 ft (three metres) long. They discovered that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the Velociraptor. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon - whereas it is actually classified in the other basic dinosaur division – Saurischia, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The different parts of the body of Chilesaurus were adapted to a particular diet and way of life, which was similar to other groups of dinosaurs. As a result of these habits, different regions of the body of Chilesaurus evolved resembling those present in other, unrelated groups of dinosaurs - a phenomenon called evolutionary convergence. Chilesaurus represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence. For example, its leaf-shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs. 'Chilesaurus can be considered a \"platypus\" dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution,’ Martín Ezcurra, a researcher at the University of Birmingham explained. Painstaking: Close inspection of the fossils revealed that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod, the Velociraptor. The process of excavating the skeleton is shown . The presence of herbivorous theropods was, up until now, only known in close relatives of birds but Chilesaurus (illustrated left) shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than thought. Its fossils were found at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile, marked with a red star on the map, right . ‘In this process, a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures. ‘Chilesaurus provides a good example of how evolution works in deep time and it is one of the most interesting cases of convergent evolution documented in the history of life. 'Chilesaurus shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups.’ He believes that this study will force palaeontologists to take more care in identifying fragmented and isolated dinosaur bones. Dr Fernando Novas, of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, led the research on Chilesaurus. Seven-year-old Diego Suárez (pictured left) came across the fossils when he and his sister, Macarena, were looking for decorative stones. He was at the site while his his geologist parents, Manuel Suarez (pictured right) and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes . Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. Here, a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils . He said: ‘Chilesaurus is the first complete dinosaur from the Jurassic Period found in Chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere. ‘Although plant-eating theropods have been recorded in North America and Asia, this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass. ‘Chilesaurus was an odd plant-eating dinosaur only to be found in Chile. ‘However, the recurrent discovery in beds of the Toqui Formation of its bones and skeletons clearly demonstrates that Chilesaurus was, by far, the most abundant dinosaur in southwest Patagonia 145 million years ago.' The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over the course of 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping the unlikely transformation. The tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller. The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation . Theropods, meaning ‘beast-footed’, were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. 'These bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs,' said co-author Darren Naish, a palaeontologist at the University of Southampton. Lead author Associate Professor Michael Lee, from the University of Adelaide, said: 'Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs.' 'Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly. ‘Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.' Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree. They used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches.\n",

The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating as she unveils yet another stylish range . The star, 27, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle has been using the SoulMateFood delivery service and says she will be continuing the healthy eating plan when she comes back to Manchester while filming over the next couple of weeks. Loved by Daisy Lowe and Una Foden, the alkaline food delivery service allows you to create your own healthy menus, which are delivered straight to your front door. 'It's perfect for me as I am always on the go at the moment and I can always have it with me,' she said of the meal service. When she's cooking for herself at home, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The flawless star, who found fame on Coronation Street, reveals that her simple but effective beauty secrets are  drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed . The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.' In between posing in beauty shoots and designing her own Lipsy range, Michelle has been filming for new projects and is in talks for a new movie .\n",

            "Help for Heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep World War II veteran Robert Clark in his own home after a London council refused to pay for his ongoing care. Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to stay with the 96-year-old former prisoner of war, despite the fact that Mr Clark spent his £50,000 life savings on contributing to his care. Now, the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Help for Heroes has given Robbie Clark, pictured, an emergency grant so he can remain at home in London . The JustGiving paged more than half of the £5,000 target within a couple of hours of it going live this morning . However, Help for Heroes has launched its own JustGiving page to help Mr Clark. The charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future. They have so far raised £2,736.22 of the £5,000 needed. Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance. Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country. 'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again. 'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.' Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war  - and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund. Having spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'. Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war. A total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said. More than £2,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page. Mr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the ‘death march’ in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain’s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. For the past two years he has used his £50,000 savings to pay towards a £960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed £350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: ‘This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. ‘He’s as good as told me that if he has to move, he’ll just give up on life. Whenever he’s been in hospital, he … pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. ‘He hates being anywhere which isn’t familiar … going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.’ Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council’s Phil Porter said: ‘We recognise Mr Clark’s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people … are in. ‘However … the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.’ He added: ‘Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.’ The council said Mr Clark’s needs can be met in a care home for £451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: ‘We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.’ He added that the council had offered ‘a deferred payment which means he doesn’t need to sell his house to pay for his care’. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark’s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.\n",

            "The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival . During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay . You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century . The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle . The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

            "When a man arrived at a hospital in India complaining of a stomach ache, doctors suspected it might be a run-of-the-mill case of food poisoning or an ulcer. However they were amazed to find the man had actually swallowed hundreds of coins and nails. Over a three year period Rajpal Singh, 34, had swallowed 140 coins, 150 nails and a handful of nuts, bolts and batteries. He had also gulped down screws, nails and magnets. Rajpal Singh, 34, had hundreds of coins and other objects removed from his stomach after complaining of an ache. The image shows an X-ray with the mass of metal objects shown in white in his stomach . Doctors were amazed when an endoscopy (a long thin tube with a camera attached) revealed hundreds of foreign objects inside Mr Singh's stomach. The endoscopy is pictured . Over a three year period, Mr Singh had swallowed, 140 coins, 150 nails and nuts and bolts, batteries and magnets. Some of the objects removed are pictured . When doctors carried out an endoscopy – inserting a long, thin, tube with a camera attached to the end – it revealed the hundreds of foreign objects in his stomach. Mr Singh, a farmer from Bathinda in India's western state of Punjab, said his bizarre habit began after he fell into a depression, and eating metal objects brought him comfort. He said: 'I used to gulp down coins and metals with fruit juice or milk. 'Due to family problems I had slipped into depression and got hooked onto this weird habit. 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died. 'I feel much more relaxed now. I am never going to do this again.' Mr Singh claims he didn't realise his stomach pain was due to his habit of eating metal objects. Doctors have carried out 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects, as well as a nine-hour operation. But Mr Singh will still need another procedure to remove the rest of the metal . Pictured are X-rays of Mr Singh's stomach, revealing the mass of foreign objects. Mr Singh said: 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died' Dr Gagendeep Goyal (pictured centre in blue) led a team of five doctors who carried out the operation to remove the objects from Mr Singh's abdomen . He went to many medical centres in Punjab complaining of a painful ache in his abdomen, but no doctors could diagnose the problem. Finally, Dr Gagandeep Goyal, a gastroentologist at a local hospital, carried out an X-ray and revealed the mass of metal deep in Mr Singh's stomach. He has since carried out more than 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects - yet some still remain. Leading a team of  five doctors, he also carried out a nine hour operation to remove more of the metal, yet Mr Singh will still need another operation to remove the rest. Dr Goyal said: 'The patient came to us with severe stomach pain. When we did the endoscopy we were shocked to see so many foreign bodies, including coins and sharp objects in his stomach. 'Though we have managed to remove most of them, there are still sharp injects and coins in his stomach. 'His body is too fragile to sustain another operation now so we plan to operate again in about seven days and remove the remaining objects.' Mr Singh says he feels calmer now and will not swallow metal objects again. Pictured are some coins removed from his stomach .\n",

            "A Canadian prostitute says that she wishes  other people wouldn't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job. Celine Bisette, who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career, insists she is neither 'damaged' nor 'deranged' - that, in fact, she rather enjoys being a prostitute, and it's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy. 'I am embarrassed to be a sex worker, even though I like my job, I’m good at it, and I’ve made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years,' she wrote in a recent essay for xoJane. This pro has pride: Canadian prostitute Celine Bisette, pictured here, wishes other people wouldn't make her feel embarrassed about her job . First, Celine would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they've made about prostitutes. She claims that she didn't have an abusive childhood, she's not a 'hyper-sexual nympho', and she isn't uneducated. She had 'an incredibly fortunate upbringing', she said, adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister: '[It was] just about the best any child could possibly hope for.' Then, as a 19-year-old college sophomore, she found herself in need of a way to pay for school. A minimum-wage job wouldn't earn her enough money, and she didn't want to take out student loans. Her best option, she said, was the sex industry. 'I couldn’t bring myself to do porn, and I knew wasn’t talented enough to be a stripper,' she explained. Working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for Celine, as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills. It just didn't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision. In the beginning, she'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part-time work. She was still out-going then, she said, and never felt self-conscious. But peoples' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job. They would lecture her, insult her, and accuse her of being a 'traitor to feminism'. One friend told everyone in their social circle that Celine must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career, and might have even been molested as a child. The rumor took off, and Celine lost a lot of friends in the process. Now, after about a decade in the industry, she is much more reticent about revealing what she does, for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions. But while she has a 'mainstream' part-time job that she uses as a 'cover', she finds it frustrating that she can't be more open. 'I wish I could feel proud of who I am and what I do,' she said. 'I’m tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed.' Sexy and smart: Celine, who wants to keep her real identity a secret, says she's more than just an escort - she also has her master's degree in sociology . Even when she does tell people about her work as an escort, Celine makes a point to emphasize that she also has a master’s degree in sociology: 'I hype it up and draw attention to it, as if to say, “Yes, I’m a [prostitute], but I’m also smart and normal, really, I promise!”' Because of the social stigma, she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy, her schedule is flexible, and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study. Plus, she explained, she can't erase her history in the sex industry. 'I will always be seen as damaged goods, whether I am a current sex worker or a former one. So I might as well just keep going, right?' In fact, despite liking her job, it's not Canada's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give Celine pause - being paid for sex is legal, but living off that payment of it is not. Rather, it's the negative reactions to her job that make her regret ever taking up sex work at all. 'I wish I’d known what I was getting myself into before I jumped into this line of work,' she said. 'But most of all, I wish I’d never become a prostitute in the first place.'\n",

            "Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton\" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight's bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight's health that he is \"doing much better.\" The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a \"snitch\" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton,\" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant, and he is then approached by Sloan, who was working security on the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over a second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter later died. In closing arguments prior to the judge's ruling, Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. \"Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor,\" Knight's attorney argued. \"There's no intent to kill, there's an intent to survive.\" \"Even without a gun, we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight,\" the defense attorney said. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. Sloan \"needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor,\" Fletcher said. \"He is the person who got Terry (Carter) killed.\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in \"mutual combat situation\" where he used his car as deadly weapon. If Knight \"ever had the right of self-defense, the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over, he lost the right of self-defense,\" Barnes said. \"There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time.\" Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.\n",

Right now it's something that I love doing, and squeeze into my hectic life when I can. 'I can't imagine a greater life, being able to shoot landscapes AND make my monthly mortgage payment. There's nothing greater professionally than being paid to do what you love.' Blur: Chapple took this image in Queensland, Australia. He has worked as both a news and showbusiness photographer . Mystery: Light peers through trees in an Oregon forest . Rocky stop: Waves crash against rocks in Western Australia . Make a break for it: The Cook Islands' Rarotonga is seen covered in trees . Long way out: A pier is seen at Busselton Jetty in Western Australia . Dramatic: Rocks in Western Australia are bathed in sunlight as waves pour over . Sweet treat: Chapple took this image of Sugarloaf Rock while traveling through Western Australia . Natural beauty: Chapple has said of his photography 'I am self taught. Funnily enough, I failed art in school' Cosmopolitan: No stranger to inclement weather, Seattle's skyscrapers are seen underneath dark skies . Washed ashore: A colorful boat is seen at Crow Point in North Devon, England . He also told the publication he's been able to use his errors and move forward, saying 'I am self taught. Funnily enough, I failed art in school. 'I completed an apprenticeship when I finished school, but I was really only shown what I'd done wrong, as opposed to what I'd done right, so I found that I learned mostly from my mistakes. In years following, it was really trial and error and learning the hard way.' Chapple revealed during the 2012 interview a motivation to preserve the way the world looks for his family. He told Landscape Photography Magazine 'The biggest moment of clarity as a photographer came with the birth of my first son, Radley Danger Chapple (yes, Danger really is his middle name). 'After a conversation with my father-in-law about how visibility in the mountains has decreased so much in his lifetime because of air pollution, I suddenly felt a real urgency to capture images that my children can share with their grandchildren. 'We live in a changing world, and photography is the only way of documenting exactly what I see for future generations.' For more of Chappel's work, visit his website or his Facebook page.

            "This is the surreal moment a dog takes the reins and literally drags his owner out for a walk. Dashcam footage, shared by dailymotion.com user Vidsking, shows a giant St. Bernard  running across a road somewhere in the Czech Republic with a child trailing behind. It appears to be a rather uncomfortable excursion, with the young boy going along the ground on his belly with his legs stretched out behind. As the canine scampers along, his passenger holds tightly to a leash. Two men watching the bizarre scene from their car are heard chuckling in the background. They're forced to slow down  to avoid hitting the animal and human train. Once the dog reaches the other side of the road, it makes its way over a muddy verge. At that point the boy gets up and stumbles forwards. Another pedestrian is seen on the roadside but he doesn't appear to be overly fazed by the scene. According to the video time stamp, the incident took place on March 3 just past 5pm. 'A dog walks a child,' the cameraman casually titled the unusual piece of footage.

            "This is the dramatic moment a brave village watchman fought off a wild leopard armed with only a stick in India. The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting. The dramatic incident recorded by a terrified onlooker took place in Olani village, in central India .\n",

            "Almost 50 people a year die of skin cancer after being exposed to the sun at work in the UK, research shows. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised. IOSH executive director of policy Shelley Frost said: 'We've a clear picture for the UK now of the number of people diagnosed with or dying from skin cancer because of sun exposure at work. 'It's a terrible disease but with some simple measures we can ensure people who work outside are not exposed to the solar radiation that causes it. 'Work-related skin cancer is avoidable but businesses and their employees hold the key to beating it and today we are showing them how it can be done.'\n",

            "Washington (CNN)The U.S. said Tuesday that deploying warships to Yemen to monitor nearby Iranian vessels has given America \"options\" for how it could react to Iran's behavior in the region. The warships are being deployed to monitor ships traveling from Iran that could be trafficking arms to Houthi rebels in Yemen, U.S. officials told CNN, saying the move was also meant to reassure allies in the region. \"By having American sea power in the region, we have created options for ourselves,\" said Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. He noted that the nine ships in the Iranian convoy were cargo ships, but he declined to specify what they were carrying beyond \"containers.\" International officials are concerned that Iran could surreptitiously attempt to transfer weaponry to the Houthis. President Barack Obama told MSNBC that the United States has been clear in its messages to Tehran on sending weapons to Houthi rebels inside Yemen. \"What we've said to them is if there are weapons delivered to factions within Yemen that could threaten navigation, that's a problem,\" Obama said in the interview, a clip of which aired on NBC Nightly News. \"We're not sending them obscure messages, we send them very direct messages about it,\" Obama said. While the Iranian ships remain in international waters, the U.S. and other partner nations can keep an eye on the Iranian ships to see if they move toward Yemeni territorial waters. But it would be an extraordinary step and certainly not a foregone conclusion that the U.S. would attempt to board an Iranian ship if it entered Yemeni waters, U.S. officials said. \"I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships,\" State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Tuesday. \"The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe.\" Warren too added that he was unaware of any direct contact between the American and Iranian vessels at this point. The Obama administration and U.S. defense officials maintain the primary purpose of positioning additional U.S. warships in the region is to ensure the free flow of commerce through established international shipping lanes and to ensure maritime security in the region. There is a message for Iran as well. A U.S. military official told CNN that aircraft from aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt are also conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" to monitor all maritime traffic moving through the area the Roosevelt is operating in to determine what is going on there in order to assist in making informed decisions. This official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships in the region was taken in order to assure the freedom of navigation through established international shipping lanes and ensuring maritime security and not to interdict Iranian ships. The Roosevelt aircraft carrier and the guided missile cruiser USS Normandy were the two ships the Navy moved into the waters off the coast of Yemen on Sunday. At this stage, there are nine U.S. naval ships operating off the coast in Yemen. \"The United States alongside the international community, including the United Nations, is serious about the Iranians not providing weapons to the Houthis,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. \"Providing weapons to the Houthis only exacerbates the violence and instability in this region in a way that will have continued terrible impact on the humanitarian situation in the country.\" The heightened tensions could have broader consequences for the relationship between the U.S. and Iran, coming weeks after the announcement of a framework agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program. Officials on Capitol Hill and elsewhere pointed out that the situation in Yemen adds an additional challenge when it comes to reaching a final deal. \"I don't think this changes something directly, but it does highlight that Iran has a number of activities around the region and around the world that are problematic,\" Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN Tuesday. \"It includes their missile program, it includes their growing influence in Iraq, it includes their propping up of (President Bashar al-) Assad in Syria and their fueling this war in Yemen.\" U.S. warships from the carrier group of the Roosevelt are joining allied vessels from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other partner nations prepared to intercept a convoy of seven to nine Iranian vessels believed headed for Yemen. \"We are closely monitoring all maritime activity in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden,\" Cmdr. Kevin Stephens of the Fifth Fleet told CNN. \"We not going discuss the number and types of vessels we are monitoring or speculate about the possible destination or cargo of those vessels.\" When asked about warnings from Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to keep Iranian navy ships away from Yemen, the commander of Iran's Regular Navy, Flotilla Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, said his fleet was operating legally. \"We don't let anyone give us warnings and threats, because we are working according to international law and regulations,\" he said. \"And we work for the security of our country and other countries.\" Sayyari added that Iranian navy ships in the area were there to combat piracy and secure the safe transfer of goods through the waters. U.S. ships do not have authority to forcibly board Iranian-flagged ships. Earlier this month, a U.S. Navy ship consensually boarded a Panamanian-flagged vessel suspected of trafficking people, drugs or weapons. Nothing was found. The U.S. warships come to a region seeing a good deal of U.S. military activity. The Roosevelt in particular only recently arrived in the theater and had been in the Arabian Gulf supporting Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria, according to Stephens. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on the \"Situation Room\" that he would only endorse U.S. air power against Yemen if it was the only option. \"It is a very serious escalatory step,\" he said on Monday. \"If you're going to use U.S. air power, what else is going to happen to make sure you stop the Houthis?\" McCain blamed President Barack Obama's foreign policy for the deteriorating situation. \"It was very obvious to many of us that this did not have to happen,\" McCain said. \"We did not take care of the regime that was in place, the president that was in there. It is a symptom of our failure throughout the Middle East.\" CNN's Jim Acosta, Frederik Pleitgen, Theodore Schleifer and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.\n",

            "The Rubik's Cube has puzzled the minds of millions for decades, with most people giving up before ever coming close to finishing the notoriously difficult game. But not teenager Collin Burns, who has completed a cube in just 5.25 seconds, smashing the world record. The US national 'speedcubing' champion was at an official Rubik's Cube event in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, when he shaved 0.3 of a second off the record. Genius: Teenager Collin Burns completed a Rubik's Cube in just 5.25 seconds, breaking the world record . Unbelievable: Collin looks up at the clock after finishing the puzzle, clearly astonished by his achievement . Other teenagers can be seen chatting in the background as they completed their own puzzles at the official World Cube Association (WCA) meeting this weekend. Meanwhile Collin is focused on his cube, quickly spinning the rows of tiles round as the clock counts upward from zero. As the 3x3 Rubik's Cube's colours align, he drops it down on to a pressure sensor which stops the watch, bringing gasps from his fellow enthusiasts as they realise he has set a new fastest time. Collin breaks into a huge smile as he sees his accomplishment, which was 0.3 seconds quicker than the previous world record of 5.55 seconds, set by Dutchman Mats Valk. Other Rubik's Cube enthusiasts dash over to see what has happened as people begin to cheer . The US national 'speedcubing' champion was at an official Rubik's Cube event in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, when he shaved 0.3 of a second off the record . The gathered teenagers suddenly break into cheers as they crowd round to get a closer look, patting Collin on the back and shaking his hand. A WCA representative told Mashable that the teenager had officially broken the record. 'Although this result has not been uploaded to the WCA database just yet, we can confirm that this is (or will be soon) the new official WCA world record for the 3x3x3 single solve category,' the spokesman said. 'To our best knowledge, it has been performed in an official competition, with all the rules being followed, even the scramble has been checked for its correctness.'\n",

            "It is cold, remote, dangerous, and a hot spot for one of the world's most volatile and entrenched political stand-offs. So it comes as a surprise that the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - located along the no-man's land between the North and South - is next to a burgeoning surf spot for South Korean hipsters, gangsters, ex-pats and its jet-setting adventure class. Photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day-to-day duties, where fishermen and day-trippers are placed alongside soldiers, tanks and their fortified military installations. The DMZ was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the North from the South. Surfer Shannon Aston, from New Zealand, said he felt compelled to start photographing the area while he was living and working in South Korea as a teacher. Mr Aston added: 'The military is ever present and must be respected and everybody does (respect it), but Korea has been divided for decades, so life just goes on. 'There was never much tension, only when people in the north would defect near that coast or security was ramped up after a skirmish or incident between the two countries.' The beaches, often filled with foreigners and day-trippers from the capital Seoul, features an 'overlapping' of military installations along the coast as it nears the border with the north, he said. Scroll down for video . A group of soldiers pose for a photo with a surfboard at one of the military installations on the South's border with North Korea .

Surfers ride the waves along one of the remote beaches scattered located a few hours drive north wast of Seoul . A longboarder prepares to head out into the waves. Although it is located in a politically volatile area, the beaches have become increasingly popular in recent years with South Korea's middle class . He said: 'Most surfers will ride waves wherever they can, extreme cold, lakes, river and everything in between. 'Most don't care too much as long as they can surf. The Korean surfers are used to it and the foreigners just feel lucky to get some waves in a place where it is not famous for surfing.

            "Bingo hall toilets have tested positive for traces of Class A drugs amid evidence that an increasing number of pensioners are turning to hard drugs in retirement. Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper’s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted: Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured, Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.\n",

Byron's buds measure a whopping 8.6cm across - the same width as a beer mat and 2cm wider than an iPhone 6. His daughter Emily, 14, is not far behind at 7.3cm and hold's the record for the widest female tongue while her father has the men's crown. Scroll down for video . Emily and Byron Schlenker are the world record holders for having the widest female and male toungues . The father and daughter have been recognised by Guinness World Records and have tongues a whopping 8.6cm and 7.3cm wide respectively . Byron only found out he was a world-beater when he picked up a Guinness World Records book at the library while helping his daughter with a school project . A young Byron aged 10 before he, and his tongue, grew into record breakers . Byron, 47, only discovered his tongue was the widest in the world when he picked up a copy of the Guinness Book of World Records while helping Emily with a school project at the library. After measuring his tongue, he found it was nearly a centimetre wider than the then record holder's. Since his tongue was officially dubbed the world's widest he has become something of a celebrity in his hometown of Syracuse, New York. The project manager said: 'The book goes all over the world and it's neat to see people's responses on Facebook and things like that.'

            "Four Royal Navy sailors charged with the gang rape of a young woman at an alcohol-fuelled party at a Canadian barracks must stay in Nova Scotia until they have been tried. The four men appeared in turn in a courtroom in Dartmouth, near Halifax, where they were given identical but unusual bail conditions that could see them having to live on a Canadian naval base for the next few years. Bail was set at over £2,000 for each of them but they also agreed to surrender their passports and live at the nearby Stadacona naval base in Halifax. Accused: Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer from Stockbridge, Hampshire, arrives at court today . Two of the accused, Simon Radford, 31, of Gosport, Hampshire and Craig Stoner, 24, from Stonehouse, Gloucestershire hid their faces as they were led to a provincial court in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia . Darren Smalley, 35, of Gosport, Hampshire, and his co-accused were ordered to surrender their passports as part of their bail conditions . In a deal agreed with the British government, they will also continue to work for the Royal Navy and draw their current pay. It was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the British High Commission who was in court refused to elaborate. The four – Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer, Craig Stoner, 24, Simon Radford, 31, and Darren Smalley, 35 – had been playing for the Royal Navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the Shearwater naval base just east of Halifax. The alleged sexual assault, in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim, took place on April 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game. Sources say their victim, who is aged in her early 20s and lives in Halifax, had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local Canadian servicemen. Yesterday, all four men – three of them wearing black Royal Navy ice hockey team hoodies – looked relieved to be getting out of custody as they respectfully answered Judge John MacDougall’s questions. Charged: Royal Navy sailors Joshua Finbow, 23, (left) and Simon Radford, 31, (right) appeared in court . Held: Craig Stoner, 24, (left) and Darren Smalley, 35, (right) are being held by military police in Canada . They all said they understood their bail conditions and Crown prosecutor Eric Taylor said outside court that the accused had not asked to be returned to the UK. They were ordered to return to court on May 27 and given the names of seven people – the victim and six witnesses – who they were forbidden to contact. They must not leave the province of Nova Scotia and cannot apply for new passports. They must remain employed by the navy and must not resign without the court’s permission. The four, no longer trying to hide their faces, later filed out of the court building and were driven away together in a large white SUV to their new home on the close Stadacona base. They ignored a question over how they might plead in the case. Commander Michael O’Sullivan, the air and naval advisor at the British High Commission, has spoken to the four and described the alleged offences as ‘serious’ but stressed they were as yet only allegations. Naval base: The East Coast Navy base at Halifax, Nova Scotia, near to where the alleged incident occurred . Military base: An aerial view of the Shearwater military base where four British sailors are accused of assaulting a civilian . The Commander, who drove the car the men left the court in, added: ‘We’re assisting the Canadian authorities with their investigation.’ The four are charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm and group sexual assault – offences that are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Crown prosecutor Eric Taylor said the investigation was still at an early stage and the results of forensic tests could result in additional charges. ‘It will be up to the Royal Navy to decide now how to employ them while their charges are working their way through the court,’ he said. Canadian military investigators have described the alleged offences as ‘a disturbing accusation of sexual assault’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

            "When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself of his confusing emotions. 'On average, statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that's not even treating it,' Nic said. 'Compared to that, I'm one of the lucky ones.' A high achiever from a young age, Nic (pictured left and right) 'crashed' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school . His anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months . But along with the cold, stale, square rooms, the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort: other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness. 'I really liked that psych ward. I didn't want to leave because I met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world … and the reason I really got along with these guys was because it was the first time I had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue. 'They'd be like \"what have you got?\" and I'd say \"I think I have psychosis or depression\" and they'd just say \"OK, cool. Do you want to play Nintendo now?\" That planted the seed a little bit: maybe talking about this stuff is really helpful, not damaging.' The level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that Nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother Christopher. 'Everyone was really worried about me being suicidal because it was such a measured thought-out decision for me - I was sort of at the point where I was convinced there was no point in living but couldn't deal with the guilty because my family had been so good to me,' Nic said. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic (pictured) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun . 'Then Chris ended up killing himself when I had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18. 'He had his heart set on being a professional rugby player but had some problems with his legs and had to get surgery. He was bed ridden for a while and that made his depression and anxiety a lot worse because he pretty much just lived for rugby. 'He became withdrawn: he wouldn't talk about his depression. I was open about it to close friends and family whereas he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man. Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Nic's eldest brother was left to organize Christopher's funeral while his mother became a recluse and the rest of the family tried to shield Nic from the event, desperate to avoid another tragedy. Christopher's (left and right) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby: 'He would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man' 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness. 'After he died there were five chairs at the dinner table and only four people and you can't ignore that. We started having dinner in front of the television permanently because, what do you talk about? How can you discuss anything and have that chair sitting there?' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. His death shattered their family: 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness,' Nic said (pictured from a young age with his brothers and father) 'Our first family Christmas in a very long time, just last year': Left to right Ben and his son Zach, mum, dad, Nic's best friend Ryle, Nic, and family friend Daisy . 'I'd had heaps of different meds for heaps of different diagnosis. I'd had shock therapy when I was 16 which was once I'd had every meds that existed for the condition and meant we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel by falling back on like 1960s meds,' he said. 'But it wasn't that the meds weren't working or the dosage was wrong, it was that I was being treatment for something I didn't have.' 'Now things are good. I take a small maintenance dose of medication, one pill a day, with no side effect: a mood stabilizer which just feels like taking a vitamin. I've got a great job working in mental health, I live with my best friend, have a great girlfriend - I don't want to say it's perfect, but what a dramatic turnaround!' As an outspoken advocate for mental health and suicide prevention who advocates loudly about the importance of seeking help, Nic aims to raise awareness about the importance of GPs - the front-line of any mental health help and diagnosis - brushing up on mental illness research and data to improve diagnoses . As an outspoken advocate for mental health and suicide prevention who advocates loudly about the importance of seeking help, Nic aims to raise awareness about the importance of GPs - the front-line of any mental health help and diagnosis - brushing up on mental illness research and data to improve diagnoses. 'I'd also love to see people seeking help, talking about it and not being afraid, humiliated or ashamed. It's the only way to reduce stigma and make it not a big scary shameful thing. 'You're not a freak, a lot of people have these feelings and we're only doing ourselves a disservice by pretending we don't have problems, and they're actually really treatable.'

            "A company has released matches that continue to burn even when submerged in water or buried underground in dirt. The UCO Stormproof Matches are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to them and will start burning again once they come into contact with oxygen. The unique matches have to go through rigorous testing to make sure they keep alight in even the most difficult situations. Scroll down for video . Indestructable: The UCO Stormproof Matches (pictured) are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to it and will start burning again once it comes into contact with oxygen . Eric Moe, the product specialist at Industrial Revolution which owns Utility, Comfort and Originality (UCO), explained the process. The Stormproof matches are made by UCO which has been making outdoor accessories for the past 44 years. They include 25 matches in a completely waterproof case with and three strike pads. The matches cost £5.47 ($7.99) from UCO's website and are available from the UK distributor Dalesman International. He said: 'The match sticks are dipped into our coating, which keeps smouldering even underwater, then reignites once exposed to oxygen. 'Essentially, you aren't burning the match stick, but burning the coating on the stick. 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose. 'In all cases the flame keeps burning. The matches will still ignite if they get wet, and they are quite impact resistant.' Even when buried in sand (left), the matches can burn again once they are taken out and exposed to oxygen (right). They can also keep smouldering even while underwater . Mr Moe, 31, from Milton, near Seattle, Washington, US, said when you are in unfamiliar terrain, having a source of fire is vital for survival. He said: 'Whether they're in a snowstorm, rainstorm or wind storm, the UCO Stormproof Matches will offer heat and light. 'The importance of being able to create a fire in inclement weather cannot be overstated. 'These matches are designed to ignite and keep burning in the worst conditions. 'Everything is more challenging when you are cold and wet, and it is crucial to have reliable equipment.' The makers explained that essentially, the match stick isn't burning, it is the coating on the stick that is alight: 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose' Here the match is shown being dipped into water (left), and when it is take out (right) it is still able to burn . He explained that other devices that are used to light a fire are not always reliable. Mr Moe said: 'Lighters can fail at high altitudes, or if wet. Standard matches have little resistance to elements. Primitive techniques are excellent, but hard to execute in poor weather. 'UCO Stormproof Matches address those problems and ensure a source of fire.'\n",

            "The Long Island mother and daughter found safe and well in New York City's Upper West Side neighbourhood after going missing last month say they had no idea that people were looking for them. Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily, 14, were recognized by the front desk manager of the hotel they were staying at on Sunday, it was reported. They were found at 3am by NYPD officers and are in good health, officials said. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they disappeared. They have now been found safe and well . Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police questioned mother and daughter and now consider the case closed after releasing them. Iona called her mother at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning to tell her she was ok. 'I'm thankful my daughter is safe. She's had a lot of pressure,' Iona's mother, Diana Malcolmson, told the New York Daily News. 'She just wanted to get away.' Iona claimed she had no idea friends and family members were worried about her sudden disappearance, her mother said. 'She hadn't listened to the news. She didn't know she was causing all this trouble,' Malcolmson said. Iona is in the midst of a nasty battle over the will of her husband, George Costello Sr., 63, who died of a heart attack as he was working on a Southampton barge on Dec. 28, 2012. News of Iona's reappearance comes after more details emerged about the colorful background of her late husband's family, who were in dispute with her over the contents of Mr Costello's will. It was revealed that the mother's stepson has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' British-born Mrs Costello and Emily were visiting Manhattan when they went missing on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. Police reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . Iona's brother-in-law John Costello (right), is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr (left), 45,  has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, had also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. They were reported missing by relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm said earlier it was strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online  his force did not suspect foul play. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones had gone straight to voicemail. Mrs Costello's family have lived in both the UK and the US, but she is British by birth. Her mother Diana and late father Euan, a stockbroker, lived in Stow in the Wold, Gloucestershire before setting sail for North America in 1958 aboard the Liberte cruise ship. Their plan was to live in Canada but they instead moved to Long Island. The couple returned to the UK at some point and records indicate that Mrs Costello was born in Marylebone in Central London, as was her brother Andrew. Mrs Costello's aunt Gwendoline Preston married Lord William Wynne-Jones, a renowned chemist and former vice-chancellor of Newcastle University.\n",

            "David Curry (pictured) was asked to leave The Wallow Wetherspoon pub in Blyth, Northumberland because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms . A father was asked to leave a Wetherspoon pub for a family breakfast with his wife and stepdaughter because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms. David Curry, 49, had travelled ten miles from  home to visit The Wallow in Blyth, Northumberland, for the first time with wife Vee, 45, and her daughter Kayleigh. But when the family arrived Mr Curry was told he could not stay in the pub because he was wearing a pair of £40 Adidas trousers. The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry, from Ashington, but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013. 'I go to my local Wetherspoon pub in Ashington all the time wearing track suit bottoms and we have never been denied entry,' said Mr Curry. 'We decided to go to this one instead for a change of scene. 'We had just walked in and were just about to go to the bar when a waiter said \"excuse me you have got to leave, you are wearing track suit bottoms\". 'I couldn't believe it. I just had to laugh and walk away.' Instead, the family travelled back to Ashington and went to a nearby pub for Sunday lunch. Self-employed builder Mr Curry said he often wears sportswear as part of a health regime that saw him shed 17 stone through exercise and giving up alcohol. He had been drinking 25 pints a day and ballooned to 28 stone, but changed his ways and started running up to 20 miles a day after being told he would die if he did not lose weight. Teaching assistant Mrs Curry said the pub chain has lost money by turning the family away at the door. 'I said you are joking! We had just come for our breakfast. When Mr Curry arrived at the pub with his wife and stepdaughter he was told he could not order a drink because of his attire . 'Dave was wearing a pair of £40 trousers, they weren't cheap. 'Yet he was being told to leave by a waiter who hadn't even ironed his uniform. The waiter looked really scruffy. 'There are people wearing tracksuit bottoms in Wetherspoons all the time. 'It was the first time we had ever visited that Wetherspoon pub and we won't be coming back. 'We just left - we were fuming.' Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: 'Wetherspoon apologise to the gentleman and completely understand his disappointment. The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013 . 'The pub has operated a no tracksuit policy since opening towards the end of 2013. 'We appreciate that the gentleman in question wasn't aware of this and we would also ask our staff to use discretion. 'However on this occasion the fact is he was refused service and to reiterate we apologise to him for this.' Mr Gershon said the no tracksuit policy is only in place in Blyth, Northumberland, and not in other Wetherspoon branches.\n",

            "ALL DAY LONG . By Joanna Biggs . (Serpent’s Tail £14.99) Famously and memorably, the poet Philip Larkin asked: 'Why should I let the toad work / Squat on my life?' He longed to be '... courageous enough / To shout Stuff your pension! - but knew he never would. Coffee morning: Britain at work . The tyranny of the nine-to-five is about money (of course), but also about moral worth: we work because we know we should 'pull our weight' in society's tug-of-war. On any morning, in any town or city all over the world, people stream into their places of work, some driven by a sense of vocation, some by resigned boredom, some by greed, some by need. Surely it is work, not love, which makes the world go round? Joanna Biggs offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis (thank goodness), but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country. Reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the Sixties with no worries about finding a job. We were lucky. Joanna Biggs makes it bleakly clear that for many people today, 'the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds'. Biggs divides her workers in interesting categories, yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function. So the 'Making' chapter gives us a potter, a shoemaker and (yes) a robot, which introduces us to its maintenance engineers. 'Serving' includes a sex worker, two baristas, a call centre adviser and a political special adviser. Those 'Repairing' are a rabbi, an Army major and a nurse, while those 'Leading' are a company director, a stay-at-home mum (inspired, that one) and a hereditary lord. Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me' The scope of the book is broad. We meet those who are selling, entertaining, thinking, caring - as well as a curious clutch of people Biggs lumps together under 'Starting': a goldsmith's apprentice (one of my favourites), a rebellious intern, an entrepreneur specialising in 'start-up' technologies, an unemployed graduate. There's also a 56-year-old man on Mandatory Work Activity, usually known as 'workfare' - the Government initiative designed for those on Jobseeker's Allowance, to help them 'gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work... while at the same time making a contribution to the community'. Joanna Biggs clearly does not think very much of 'workfare': in fact, it's clear she despises the scheme. Here, although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect, I wish she hadn't editorialised so overtly. I really wanted to hear more about what John thought of his life. A book which aims to give the reader much-needed insight into other people's lives (and it certainly does that) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader: 'A citizen's income set at the right level - £320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low-paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the UK.' At that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy, with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met. ALL DAY LONG By Joanna Biggs . In the Seventies I was a huge admirer of the work of America's Studs Terkel and England's Tony Parker, both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice, by using recorded interviews, carefully transcribed, with no questions included and no comment or judgment. It was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly (and sometimes shockingly) into the hearts and minds of prisoners, drifters, miners, people on a housing estate, and so on. You felt you got to know them without the author-interviewer standing in the way - although, of course, all interviews have to be edited. Joanna Biggs invokes Terkel: 'I've often wondered what (he) would think of how we think about work now.' Well, I reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard, without surprise, and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould. In contrast, Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me: it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand, and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other.' At the end, she lays her cards on the table, confessing that as she listened to people's stories, 'I most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it's organised now.' That's the trouble with the workers, you see. They've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life, turning their backs on revolution.\n",

            "A New York college has provoked anger after postponing its screening of movie American Sniper in response to complaints from Muslim students. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history . The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI’s Muslim Students’ Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis . A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to ‘participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events’. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas . The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was ‘a mistake’ to call off the screening. ‘The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,’ Harper’s statement read. ‘We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.’ An Alternative screening of the Paddington Bear movie was offered to those students who did not want to watch the American Sniper.

            "Lindsay Lohan has been living in London for the past year and says she likes it so much, she doesn't see herself returning to the States any time soon. The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video . Staying put: Lindsay Lohan says she feels 'at home' in London and has no plans to return to the States just yet . Fleur Du Mal Leather Corset . Available at Forward by Elyse Walker . Visit site . We haven't heard much from Lindsay in the US since she moved across the pond to London. But if her latest photo shoot for Homme Style magazine is any indication, she's making a comeback in a major way. The Mean Girls star showed of her svelte figure in a series of racy ensembles by Moschino and Agent Provacateur. Here she poses wearing nothing but a Fleur Du Mal leather corset, La Perla panties, and a pair of Moschino gloves. Corsets were hot on the Spring runways at Givenchy and Versace and continue to be a wardrobe staple for sultry celebs like Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Lindsay's leather number is available to purchase for just under $1,000.

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same \"situations\" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'\n",

            "Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri is expecting a 'boring' match against AS Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, believing that both sides will adopt a cautious approach. 'Our target is to get through this round and reach the semi-finals, and if we qualify 1-0 or 1-1 (on aggregate), that's all the same to me,' said Allegri, whose side are at home in the quarter-final first leg on Tuesday. 'It could be a boring game, the important thing is not to concede a goal at home.' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri strolls in to his pre-match press conference on Monday . The Juventus squad look relaxed as they are put through their paces in sunny Turin . Allegri warned that Monaco, who have conceded only four goals in eight games on their way to the quarter-finals, would be a completely different proposition to Borussia Dortmund, who Juventus beat 5-1 on aggregate in the last 16. 'The tie against Monaco is much more complicated than the one against Dortmund,' he said. 'They are two very different teams, the French side concede few goals and it's always more complicated to play against a team that doesn't go forward very often. Veteran midfielder Andrea Pirlo has returned to training after a calf injury . Claudio Marchisio looks focused as he engages in a training drill on Monday . Arturo Vidal (left) and Fernando Llorente will both be hoping to start in the Champions League quarter-final . 'It's tempting to go forward ourselves and there is the risk of leaving spaces for them. We need patience, humility and intelligence, and to realise that we are not going to settle qualification in Turin. 'I think they (Monaco) have richly deserved to get to the quarter finals,' added Allegri. 'They conceded one goal in six games during the group stage, eliminating Benfica and Zenit St Petersburg. In Ligue 1, they have the best defence with 22 goals conceded (in 32 games). These figures do not come by chance.' Experienced defender Giorgio Chiellini smiles as he talks to the media on Monday afternoon . Allegri said that playmaker Andrea Pirlo had been included in the squad after recovering from a calf muscle injury, and he now had to decide whether the 35-year-old could be plunged into the tie after a seven-week lay-off. 'Pirlo hasn't played for more than 40 days, I'll decide after the last training session,' he said.\n",

Mayweather was photographed taking the scales for the WBC’s mandatory weight check 30 days before a world title fight. The boxers are required to weigh no more than 10 per cent in excess of the 147 lb welter limit. Floyd Mayweather is down to within three-and-a-half pounds of the welterweight limit ahead of mega-fight . The electronic machine showed Mayweather at 150.5 lbs. There was a modicum of surplus fat at the sides of his waist but he looks well on track with his conditioning. Pacquiao is also understood to be comfortably within the 30-day stipulation. The checks are designed to prevent boxers draining off too much poundage at the last minute, which increases the risk of brain damage through fluid loss. Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . Both men will weigh-in again seven days before the fight, when they must be within five per cent of the welterweight limit. Earlier on Wednesday Mayweather took to his Instagram account to show that rest and recovery is just has important as his tough training regime. Mayweather, who is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak against the Filipino fighter, posted a video of himself receiving a SubZero recovery cool down in Las Vegas. The cold sauna, known as a Cryotherapy Chamber, is used to help rejuvenate the body after a heavy workout. A session at -200 degrees usually lasts 1-3 minutes and helps speed up muscle recovery as well as decrease inflammation and muscle soreness after exercise. The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 .\n",

            "Brendan Rodgers has vowed to do 'what is best' for Daniel Sturridge as the Liverpool striker's injury misery shows no sign of relenting. Sturridge will again be absent for Tuesday night's trip to Hull and while Rodgers will not take the drastic step of calling time on his campaign, he remains unsure whether the England international will play again this season. The 25-year-old missed five months with calf and thigh issues and he is now battling to overcome a hip problem that was sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Daniel Sturridge may not play again this season because of a series of calf and thigh injuries . Sturridge will miss Liverpool's trip to face Hull City on Tuesday night because of injury problems . Rodgers concedes it has been a difficult year for Sturridge but maintains Liverpool's medical department will continue to nurse him back to full fitness; the manager is also determined to bring in players to ease the burden on him next season. 'It had been difficult for Daniel,' said Rodgers. 'He wants to work and play. We are just going to have to monitor it. He is a good lad and when he had been fit, he has been brilliant for us. 'He is not available, we will do what is in the best interest of him. He is going to be here for the next number of years. 'There are always names associated. It is certainly something that we need to address. Daniel is top class but we need to give him help. 'You are nearly talking about a 100 per cent deficit. We have had 14 clean sheets. That side of the game has been addressed but we need to improve the critical area.' Manchester United's defeat at Everton on Sunday has, in the words of Louis van Gaal, given Liverpool 'a glimmer of light' in the race for the top four and United's advantage could be down to one point by the time they next play.

For that to happen, Liverpool will need to beat both Hull and Queens Park Rangers and, suddenly, the 0-0 draw they had against West Brom on Saturday looks very costly but Rodgers has promised his players will not give up the chase. 'It will be a tough game at Hull,' said Rodgers. 'The idea is to go and get the victory to put the pressure on the teams above.

Rodgers, who revealed there are no further update on new contracts for Martin Skrtel and Jordon Ibe, added: 'It is always good to finish the season strong.

            "Brian Williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in Tom Brokaw's very large footsteps at NBC, according to a new report. The network handed Williams a six-month suspension in February after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from Iraq in 2003. But according to a report in Vanity Fair, Williams started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about Brokaw, whom he succeeded at Nightly News in 2004. 'I always felt he needed to jack up his stories because he was trying so hard to overcome his insecurities,' one executive told the publication. Clash: Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams are pictured in New York in 2004 - the year Williams took over Brokaw's role on the Nightly News. A new report has claimed Williams always felt insecure following him . 'And he had to follow Tom, which brought its own set of insecurities. He likes to sort of tell these grandiose tales... I just saw it as one of the quirks of his personality.' But according to former correspondents who spoke to Vanity Fair, Brokaw wasn't so accepting of the 'quirks'. The stories left him 'incensed', the publication reported. On one occasion, Williams implied they had both been in Berlin together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined the veteran newscaster there the following day. On hearing the tale, Brokaw went into 'spasms of anger', one former exec told Vanity Fair. 'Tom treated that anchor chair as a public trust,' a former employee said. 'He really was our Walter Cronkite.' Others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after Williams took over the role because even though Brokaw pushed for him to get the job, Williams never 'embraced' him. 'I don't know why,' a source said. '[Williams] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did Tom, so he never tries. That's the reason there's not a lot of support for Brian over there.' Exaggerations: During a report in February, pictured, Williams recounted a tale of how he had been on a Chinook that came under fire while in Iraq in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft . It also meant that when Williams found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed Chinook - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - Brokaw didn't have his back. A friend told the publication that while Brokaw - who was 'livid' about the scandal - didn't call for Williams to be punished, he 'didn't try to save him either.' Following the suspension, Williams reportedly declared to a friend: 'Chalk one up for Brokaw.' Not impressed: Brokaw, pictured in February, came 'incensed' when he heard Williams' exaggerations . The article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident, Williams couldn't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead, he suggested he might have a brain tumor. '(He said,) 'Did something happen to (my) head? Maybe I had a brain tumor, or something in my head',' a source said. 'He just didn't know. We just didn't know. We had no clear sense what had happened. We got the best (apology) we could get.' When it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident, NBC quickly learned Williams himself would be of no help. 'He was having a tough enough time coming to grips with the idea that he had gotten it wrong in the first place, slash misrepresented it, slash lied,' one insider said. Others suggested that the problem with Williams' work was because the newscaster, who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at Nightly News, had no interest in reporting on war stories or 'heavy' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors. His appearance on late-night talk shows and comedy series, such as 30 Rock, suggested that instead of getting into gritty news, he actually wanted his own talk show, Vanity Fair suggested. While some NBC employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered, others say it did not go down well with the network. 'He didn't want to leave New York,' one source said. 'Getting him to war zones was real tough... but when he did go, he came back with these great stories that kind of put himself at the center of things.' In February, Williams was forced to admit that he wasn't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in Iraq in 2003  - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years. 'Overwhelmed': Sources told Vanity Fair that Williams, pictured in Iraq, did not want to report on 'hard' news and didn't enjoy politics or war stories, and lacked the experience of his predecessors . Lies: During a report in 2003, he reported how a Chinook, pictured, had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down. In fact, he was on one about 30 minutes behind . It came after he claimed on the Nightly News in January that his aircraft had been hit, causing outrage from the soldiers who had actually been involved. Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire. According to the crew members, Williams arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing. Even though Williams learned about the uproar over his false story on Facebook, he failed to bring it up with NBC execs when he met with them the next day, suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff, former employees told Vanity Fair. Days after the false report, he acknowledged the lie as he spoke to a reporter. 'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.' While Williams initially believed he'd be back to work within days, he was ultimately suspended for six months, and he accepted that he had to step back, sources said. NBC Nightly News is now being anchored by Lester Holt and it is unclear if Williams will return. Questions: A number of Williams' seemingly outlandish claims also came under scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. But in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams said he saved two puppies. In the same Esquire interview, Williams also revealed he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years, Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Earlier this year, he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' He was later suspended over the incident. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.\n",

            "Arsenal should target Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech if he leaves Stamford Bridge at the end of the season, insists Carlo Cudicini. Cech has made just five Barclays Premier League appearances this season as Thibaut Courtois remains manager Jose Mourinho's first-choice goalkeeper. But Cudicini feels the 32-year-old Czech Republic international would be a good fit under Arsene Wenger instead of Wojciech Szczesny at Arsenal. Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer . Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has made just five Premier League appearances this season . Chelsea want at least £10million for Cech, and they would have to sell to a direct rival for the goalkeeper to end up at the Emirates. Prompted on TalkSport by Ray Parlour who said Arsenal 'have to get' Cech, Cudicini added: 'I agree. 'Arsenal have had a few problems with goalkeepers after [David] Seaman and [Jens] Lehmann. 'Szczesny is still struggling to impose himself as number one, so if a goalkeeper like Petr Cech is available in the summer, obviously he should be a big target for Arsenal.' Cech revealed last week he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Courtois.

            "A 33-year-old woman on trial for having sex with a male inmate at Washington County Jail six times in four months while working as a services technician is hoping to use an insanity defense, claiming she was 'vulnerable, passive and gullible' and suffers from mental illness. Brett Robinson is facing 12 charges related to sexual misconduct and official misconduct after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell multiple times and engaging in sex acts  between March and July last year. The case follows that of her colleague Lisa Curry, 39, who last month was sentenced to over four years prison for repeatedly having sex with a 25-year-old gang member and convicted rapist. Robinson, who worked in a maximum security control room known as 'the bubble', struck up a relationship with the inmate - who has not been named -  in a nearby cell. The two would talk using an intercom when Robinson's manager left the room. 'Gullible': Brett Robinson, 32, is facing 12 charges after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell at Washington County Jail and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year . Charged: Robinson allegedly brought the male inmate into the control where she worked at Washing County Jail and had sex with him on his birthday under a blanket . According to a psychologist's report obtained by Oregon Live, Robinson felt flattered by the compliments she got from the inmate and started to 'open up to him' early last year. Then, in March, the inmate asked for a kiss on his birthday. When her manager went to lunch, Robinson released the inmate from his cell and brought him into the bubble. She thought it strange that he brought a blanket with him from the cell, the report said. 'He kissed me so passionately, I was taken aback. 'I asked about the blanket. 'He said ''I was hoping we could go farther''. 'Then he was saying ''we don't have time to discuss this'', so I had sex with him.' They continued having sexual encounters, the report said, and Robinson wrote the inmate a love letter that began with 'Hi Baby'. The letter said: 'I am hoping this letter will better convey the love I feel deep inside for you. ... You are a constant presence in my thoughts, fantasies and dreams, and I feel this pervasive emptiness without you by my side. It makes it hard to go about my normal daily activities when all I do is miss you. You are my everything, Baby – I could not envision my life without you in it.' New protocol: In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . On trial: Brett Robinson, 33, faces charges of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and first-degree official misconduct . However the relationship began to sour when Robinson started hearing about the abusive conduct of the inmate elsewhere in the prison. He had passed a sexually explicit note to a nurse and also pushed a female prisoner against a wall and kissed her. The psychologist noted that Robinson was delusional about the man. The report also said she had struggled with depression and anxiety since childhood. 'There is evidence that these delusions developed in this generally vulnerable, passive and gullible woman as part of a Major Depressive and Anxiety episode,' the doctor wrote. Robinson was caught when the inmate brought up their relationship to a prison employee during an investigation about Jill Curry. The prosecution is fighting against Robinson using the insanity defense. In March Curry was sentenced to four years and two months prison. That case was very similar to the allegations against Robinson. Curry was also a services technician and was convicted of letting gang member Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25,  who was housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, out of his cell and have sex with him in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cries in court last month as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in the supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation when sentencing Curry. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.\n",

            "Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner from team-mate Chris Brunt . The West Brom players race to congratulate Morrison (top left), who headed the away side in front against Crystal Palace on Saturday . Crystal Palace (4-3-3): Speroni 6; Ward 6, Delaney 6, Dann 6, Ledley 6 (Souare 46 6); McArthur 6 (Sanogo 80), Jedinak 6 (Gayle 46 6), Puncheon 6.5; Zaha 6.5, Murray 6.5, Bolasie 8.

Craig Gardner scored a fine long range effort at Selhurst Park (above). CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . ‘You never know what to expect,’ Pulis said in regard to returning to a former club. ‘They did well for me last year and I hope I repaid them a little bit in respect to what we did in the dressing room and on the pitch. ‘It is a good club. It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didn’t come off. Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon .

West Brom captain Darren Fletcher (right) celebrates with goalscorer James Morrison after his early header at Crystal Palace . ‘Our fans are terrific in terms of the understanding of what Tony did here last year, they respected that. People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three.

            "This is the moment a 102-year-old woman who used to dance with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly got to see herself shimmy and shake on film for the first time. Alice Barker snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen. Barker had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club, and had appeared in movies commercials and television shows. This is the moment 102-year-old Alice Barker, who used to dance with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, got to see herself shimmy and shake on film for the first time . Barker (pictured far right in the video) snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen . But she had never gotten the chance to watch herself dance. She didn't even have any photographs or memorabilia to remember her years on stage. It was David Shuff, who met Barker years ago when he brought his therapy dog to her retirement home, that finally reunited the one-time famous dancer with her videos. After a long and unsuccessful first search, Shuff connected with Mark Cantor, a collector of short musical films called 'soundies' who runs the online archive Jazz on Film. It was then Shuff and Cantor discovered that Barker's videos were filed under 'Baker', a misspelling of her name - which was why no one had been able to find them before, according to Mashable. They located three of Barker's soundies, giving her the chance to finally watch her days in the chorus line, where she was almost always in the front row. 'Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing,' Barker sang along as she watched one of her routines. When Shuff asked her how many years she danced, Barker replied 'that's all I ever did, that was it!' She said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again'. Barker (pictured right in the video) had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club, and had appeared in movies commercials and television shows . David Shuff, who met Barker years ago at her retirement home, and archivist Mark Cantor helped locate and reunite the one-time famous dancer with three of her 'soundies', known then as short musical videos . Barker found herself needing to dance and move to  music at a young age. She told Shuff a story about when she was a child and her mother was preparing her for a bath. Her mother had gone to the house to retrieve something when a young Barker heard a band play nearby. 'When she came back I was gone,' said Barker. 'I was down there naked just going, dancing.' 'And then, if the band would stop playing, I'd look at them and \"come on, let's get it going, let's get it going here.\"' Barker said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again' But the most special part for Barker was getting to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said . Shuff shared Barker's story on Reddit, where he wrote that the videos were now in her possession and that they are often played in her retirement center's communal room, noting that she's a 'rock star these days'. He added that Barker knows her videos are online now and that it made her happy because she 'feels connected to the world again'. But the most special part for Barker was getting the chance to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said.

            "The yoga being taught in a San Diego County school system is not a gateway to Hinduism and doesn't violate the religious rights of students or their parents, a California appeals court ruled Friday. The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family's lawsuit trying to block the Encinitas Union School District from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes. The lawsuit brought by Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock and their two children claimed the school district's yoga classes promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity. Scroll down for video . Students hold their positions during a yoga class at Capri Elementary School in Encinitas, California, in 2012 . A California appeals court ruled yoga classes taught at Capri do not violate students' right to religious freedom . The court upheld the previous ruling in a 3-0 opinion. The district court wrote: 'While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the district are, as the trial court determined, \"devoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings.\" 'We conclude that the program is secular in purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion and does not excessively entangle the school district in religion. 'The district's yoga program does not violate our state constitution.' The First Amendment bans school-sponsored religious promotion and prayer. Yoga instructor Kristen McCloskey (right) leads third graders at Olivenhain Pioneer Elementary School in 2012 . The Sedlocks were disappointed with the ruling and are considering their options. Attorney Dean Broyles said: 'No other court in the past 50 years has allowed public school officials to lead children in formal religious rituals like the Hindu liturgy of praying to, bowing to, and worshipping the sun god.' A school distort lawyer said there were no rituals occurring in the classroom and no one was worshipping the sun or leading Hindu rites. The district said the practice is taught in a secular way to promote strength, flexibility and balance. Yoga is now taught at schools across the country, but the district is believed to be the first with full-time yoga teachers at all schools. A three-year grant from the K.P. Jois Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes Ashtanga yoga, provides twice-weekly, 30-minute classes to the district's 5,600 students. About 30 families have opted out of the classes since they began in 2011.\n",

            "A football club chairman has warned of a new breed of hooliganism in the sport – from retired grandfathers who are trying to relive their youth and encourage violence on match days. Dave Doggett, the boss of League Two outfit Cambridge United, believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals prior to games. He said violence at matches has increased recently as the older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs'. Scroll down for video . Dave Doggett, the chairman of Cambridge United, has warned of a new breed of hooliganism and believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals . Mr Doggett said violence at matches has increased recently as older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs' Writing in his club's latest programme, Mr Doggett said: 'Unfortunately football clubs still attract an undesirable element of society that appear determined to ruin the enjoyment of real supporters of football clubs. 'Our promotion to the Football League appears to have encouraged our \"risk\" from the 1980s to come out of retirement. 'Many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their \"gangs\". 'It sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality. We are working closely with police. 'Hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables. 'Our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport.' Peter Woor, a Cambridge United fan, said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as Southend United and Luton Town. He said: 'There's a tension and you feel threatened so I don't go to those places anymore. It's not worth it. 'Most places are fine though, but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden. 'I remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it's nothing like that but it's still a problem. 'These people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this. It's very sad.' Cambridge supporter Simon Dobbin, 42 (pictured with wife Nicole), remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after an away game to Southend on March 21. Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' Mr Doggett said older men were those causing violence. Pictured: Police with fans following reports of disorder outside Southend's Spread Eagle pub prior to the recent match between the Essex side and Cambridge . One Cambridge season ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said a group of about 30 fans regularly turn up to games looking for trouble afterwards. He said: 'They arrive after the game starts and then leave before it finishes to find a fight.' Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after their game away to Southend on March 21. Essex Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' and believe he was set upon by a group of thugs intent on attacking the visiting Cambridge fans. Cambridgeshire Police said the force has also seen an increase in the 'severity and volume' of football-related disorder this season. Inspector Steve Kerridge said: 'We have seen an increase in football-related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people, both in Cambridge and other locations when the club has travelled. 'The tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in Southend have been reported widely and sicken us all. Mr Doggett said Cambridge United had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to League Two last year. Pictured: Southend United's Barry Corr beats Richard Tait to the ball in last month's match . 'The club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with Cambridge United.' He said police are using football banning orders, which impose 'stringent court-backed' restrictions on individuals. He added: 'The increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary.' The warning comes as football chiefs across the country continue to promote the Kick It Out Season of Action campaign to promote respect within football.\n",

            "An American doctor climbing Everest when the devastating earthquake hit has described the heartbreaking moment her mountain guide died before her eyes, . Ellen Gallant, a cardiologist from Utah, was attempting to climb the world's tallest mountain when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck, sparking an avalanche that killed 18 people. Four US citizens who were on Mount Everest are confirmed to have died along with 15 other climbers and Sherpas. There are believed to be up to 100 Americans still missing following the disaster on Saturday. Scroll down for video . American doctor Ellen Gallant was on Everest when the devastating earthquake struck. The tremors sparked a huge avalance killing 18 people, with Ms Gallant and another doctor desperately trying to save those injured . An experienced climber, Dr Gallant (left) had been training for 10 years to climb Everest. She helped tend to survivors and those gravely injured before rescue helicopters arrived to get people off the mountainside . Survivor Dr Gallant said she and an Indian doctor rushed to help the injured in difficult conditions following the avalanche, including the gravely-ill Sherpa, but said there was nothing they could do to save his life. 'I was outside, saw this huge blast coming down', she told ABC News. 'I ran into the tent, threw myself on the floor. When the vibration stopped, I went out and radioed over to the medical tent. 'They asked me and an Indian climber (a doctor in the Indian army) to take care of head injuries. 'We worked through the night, doing rounds, handing out medication, putting in IVs. 'Of the nine patients, one of them died last night — a 25-year-old Sherpa. His blood pressure had fallen. There was nothing we could do.' Dr Gallant said they knew their lives were saved when they heard the sound of rescue helicopters landing on the mountainside, but now she is struggling to come to terms with what has happened. A critically injured person is carried on a stretcher out of Everest Base Camp following the avalanche. Dr Gallant said despite trying everything she watched a 25-year-old Sherpa die from his injuries on the mountain . The avalanche on Everest, pictured, killed 18 people including four Americans who were buried under the snow. Up to 100 US citizens are still missing following the disaster and at least 3,300 people were killed . Injured survivors from the avalanche waiting to be rescued. Dr Gallant said she is still dealing with the trauma of watching one young Sherpa died, saying: 'Now things have settled down, it's hit me hard'. 'Around 6am, we heard helicopters and we knew we would make it out of the woods. We were able to send the eight out,' she said. 'When you go to medical school, you learn to focus on the task at hand. But now that things have settled down, it's hit me hard. 'That young man who died in front of me — a 25-year-old shouldn't have to die.' Among the mountaineers who died in the disaster is a 33-year-old Google executive Dan Fredinburg Marisa Eve Girawong, a New Jersey-born doctor based at the site, and Tom Taplin, filmmaker from Denver who was recording a documentary about the treacherous summit. Dan Fredinburg, left, and Marisa Eve Girawong, right, died in the avalanche in Everest on Saturday . Californian financial advisor Scott Holder was on Everest when the devastating avalanche killed 18 people. He described how he had to zip a dead body into a sleeping bag, and was giving medicine to the injured when a doctor told him: 'Don’t worry, you are just comforting these people. Most of them are not going to survive.' Speaking to CNN, he said he felt lucky to be alive, having descended the mountain because he was suffering from a bad head cold. 'God definitely had his hand in my survival. My cold took me out of the danger zone. I guess you could say God gave me a cold.', he said. Read more here.

            "Celtic's Treble dream died on Sunday with striker Leigh Griffiths pointing the finger of blame squarely at the officials after his side's shock Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Inverness. A blatant Josh Meekings handball in the box was missed by referee Steven McLean and his team, particularly assistant Alan Muir, at the end of the first half with the Parkhead club left to rue the decision not to award a penalty and dispense a red card. A goal down at the time, Inverness fought back and eventually emerged victorious following a pulsating period of extra-time and the Celtic players could do little to hide their fury after the match. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . Despite numerous appeals, no penalty or red card was given for Meekings' handball and Inverness won . 'We have a lot of disappointed lads inside that dressing room — we've been robbed,' said Griffiths who, more than an hour after the final whistle, was still struggling to contain his own disbelief and anger. 'It was very disappointing. We had a chance to go and make history. We didn't get the result in the end.' Celtic were a Virgil van Dijk goal to the good at the time of the Meekings incident but the game was then turned on its head in the second half as Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon was sent off for a foul on Marley Watkins. Greg Tansey equalised with the resultant spot-kick and suddenly John Hughes' men were in ascendancy. With the teams level at full-time, Edward Ofere and John Guidetti swapped goals in extra-time before David Raven grabbed a 117th-minute winner — leaving the Highlanders jubilant and their opponents distraught. Parkhead manager Ronny Deila had insisted he need not say anything about the penalty incident. Scott Brown, meanwhile, stalked past with a face like thunder, lightning and Force 10 hurricane all rolled into one angry swirling mass, damned near taking the door off its hinges as he made a dramatic exit from the depths of the national stadium. 'I have asked the centre-half in the second half if it has hit his hand or his face - and he said it hit his hand 100 per cent, so in my book that's a penalty and a red card,' continued Griffiths. 'We have probably the best penalty taker in the league in Kris Commons, who I am sure would go and tuck it away to put us 2-0 up. They'd have been down to 10 men and it would have been a mountain for them to come back. Celtic's Aleksandar Tonev (centre) is challenged by Marley Watkins (left) and Edward Ofere (right) on Sunday . Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . 'I knew it was a penalty. I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. The second half has been very lucky. 'He is the one who said it hit him in the face (the additional assistant ref). I asked the ref why he didn't give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him in the face. I don't know what angle he is looking from because everyone else could see it was a penalty. 'He said the referee behind the goal said it hit him in the face and there is nothing I can do about that now. It is a game-changing decision. 'When you have officials behind the goals, they need to be doing their job. If he thinks that's him in on the face ...? 'I don't really want to say too much about the officials because I'll end up in trouble. But it's a massive, massive decision and it's cost us the game. 'Everybody was so content that we were going to win the league, we already have a trophy (the League Cup) in the bag. Everyone was saying the Scottish Cup was practically a given. But we knew we had to come here and do a job - and it's just unlucky that we never managed to get it done.' Griffiths attempts an acrobatic shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final on Sunday against Inverness . As much as Griffiths was nursing a personal grievance over being denied yet another Hampden semi-final goal, the former Hibs star felt for manager Deila, a man who has been so open about his desire to win a Treble – and his belief in this team's ability to do so. Celtic had made no bones about their determination to succeed where so many had failed, backing themselves to have the skill and strength to get the job done, whatever obstacles they might have to overcome. 'I think the gaffer is the most disappointed person out of everyone,' said the Griffiths. 'He'd only have been the third Celtic manager to have won a Treble. 'He would have made history and as players we would have become legends. But it' s difficult to do that. I said it during the week that when you are that close to winning a Treble, the games get harder. Inverness stood in our way and did a job. 'Now we have to go again and pick ourselves up for the rest of the season. We have a massive game at Dens Park on Wednesday. Dundee will be up for it, we've just played 120 minutes in a semi-final. We have three days and then we have to play Dundee at a difficult venue. But we need three points. 'This will fire us up. We aren't far away from clinching the league now. We have two hard games in the next week at Dens and Tannadice. If we go there and pick up three points from each, we will be in a real good position.' From Treble to Double, just like that. Celtic will be weary on Wednesday, certainly. But Dundee should certainly beware some kind of angry backlash. And the Dens Park ground staff may want to reinforce some of the doors. Just in case Brown takes the storm with him. Celtic pair Tonev (left) and John Guidetti look dejected after their side drops out of the Cup on Sunday .\n",

            "A lone Iraq veteran set up camp outside a shamed fraternity, which is reeling from allegations that its members drunkenly taunted wounded soldiers, spat on servicemen urinated on the U.S. flag. Perry Clawson, a former Army colonel, was pictured Friday sitting outside the University of Florida's Zeta Beta Tau frat house in Gainesville, waving a Stars and Stripes of his own. Clawson, who said the members had 'p*****d off' servicemen across the country with their actions, pitched up outside the building, proudly displayed the flag which accompanied him on two tours of duty to Iraq. Shall not be moved: Perry Clawson, a retired Army colonel, pitched up outside the Zeta Beta Tau frat house in protest of their alleged treatment of wounded veterans . Disrespected: Nicholas Connole, pictured, said that braying students spat on him and his service dog as he tried to enjoy a vacation with his wife . Service: Connole is picutred above during on of his tours of duty in the Middle East . 'Disgusting': Linda Cope, who founded the retreat to honor her wounded son, said she saw frat members urinating on the U.S. flag . He was one of many veterans to respond to unedifying allegations that Zeta Beta Tau members had abused soldiers attending the Warrior Beach vacation retreat in Panama City Beach, the Gainesville Sun reported. The charity event provides vacations for maimed soldiers, their carers and families - but ran afoul of braying frat boys holding an event of their own earlier this month. One veteran, wounded Nicholas Connole, said frat members spat on him and his service dog from their balconies. He told local TV station WJHG: 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts.' Haley Riley, whose husband is another injured veteran, said students hurled beer bottles at attendees. Linda Cope, who founded the retreat after her son lost both his legs in an IED explosion, said that rowdy students even went so far as to urinated on the American flag. Suspension: The Zeta Beta Tau chapter at the University of FLorida has been suspended, and three of its members expelled. There is nothing to suggest anybody in the photograph above was involved . Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was suspended in the wake of the allegations, which university authorities are investigating. They have charged the organization with 'causing physical or other harm, obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft and property damage'. The fraternity has expelled three members and is also holding its own investigation. The expelled frat members have not been named. It has yet to determine what exactly took place, but said in a statement that 'there is no doubt that some our members engaged in unacceptable behavior.' While Panama City Beach police were called to deal with the frat members, they ultimately let the resort management handle them, and did not file any charges or write a police report. Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was already on probation after being found guilty of holding hazing rituals at the start of this academic year. It was already restricted to a limited events program - and will face even tougher penalties than usual if the university decides to take action. Another Zeta Beta Tau chapter, belonging to Emory University in Georgia, was also caught up in the allegations, but has denied that any of its students were involved.\n",

            "A 78-year-old Connecticut man with a long criminal history was arrested on Friday, but the man's lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse intended to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in U.S. history. Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, . Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to . an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of . Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the . theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart . Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 . A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist . This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught . 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they . think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are . threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the . Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and . threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black. Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined . to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, . 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the . museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair . allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs . in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on . the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces . Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an Édouard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . FBI investigators have long said they believed organized . crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed . a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked . if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court . testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the . stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police . uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most . recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of . illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms . The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum .\n",

            "(CNN)It came a day early. Baltimore investigators handed their files on Freddie Gray's death over to prosecutors Thursday, but the public shouldn't expect much. It's largely a procedural step, and given the overtures from Baltimore officials, the state's attorney's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate. No reports will be made public, police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files, the task force assigned to Gray's death will continue investigating. \"That is just us sitting down, providing all the data we have. We will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes,\" Batts said. The Gray family's legal team had no expectations otherwise. \"I hate to say this, but I think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come,\" attorney Mary Koch said this week, \"I don't think that's going to happen based on the way the process works, and I think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what's going to happen.\" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake seemed reluctant to do so during a Thursday interview with CNN. Pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming, the mayor seemed to dance around the question. Handing over the report represents \"an inflection point,\" she said at first, before explaining that it also marks a \"continuation in a process toward justice.\" She went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times, that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution. Asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately, she said Baltimore officials had a \"duty to protect the justice process.\" Prodded on whether the public should expect her or Batts to announce findings, she said she didn't want to \"seek justice for optics\" and explained she had spoken to schools, clergy and community leaders about what to expect. Finally, asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over, she replied: \"Well, it can't be the end. There's been no charges. There's been no trial. It cannot be the end.\" The family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient, Koch said Thursday. \"We've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete, ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged, those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks,\" she said. Perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on Baltimore is that there is not one, but two investigations, seeking to determine how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody. The mayhem since Gray's April 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting, vandalism, blazes, attacks on police and firefighters, marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken, or at least outweighed, updates about the investigations. Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI \"will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks.\" Because of the Baltimore police's history, the Justice Department has been working with the force since October as part of a reform initiative that will assess \"policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens.\" Rawlings-Blake requested that the Justice Department take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Asked during her Thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in Gray's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- Rawlings-Blake, an attorney by trade, said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the Baltimore Police Department and repair the community's mistrust in police. \"Quite likely, but it could be the same situation, and at the end of the day, it's about this case and making sure we're getting this case right. It has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there. This family wants justice. They don't want us to sit here and speculate about what could've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it,\" she said. Rawlings-Blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability. \"We welcome outside review,\" police spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk has said. \"We want to be open. We want to be transparent. We owe it to the city, and we owe it to the Gray family to find out exactly what happened.\" According to police, officers encountered Gray on April 12 and he \"fled unprovoked.\" Three officers gave chase, apprehended Gray and carried him -- screaming, his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van. Once at the police station, officers requested an ambulance, which took Gray to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he died a week later. An autopsy report indicated Gray died of a spinal injury, but Batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert's analysis before issuing his final report. So far, six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay: Sgt. Alicia White, 30; Officer William Porter, 25; Officer Garrett Miller, 26; Officer Edward Nero, 29; Lt. Brian Rice, 41; and Officer Caesar Goodson, 45. Five of them have given statements to investigators, Batts said. Releasing the officers' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing, Kowalczyk said. Though the investigation is not yet complete, Batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in Gray's arrest did not follow protocol. \"We know he was not buckled in the transport wagon, as he should've been. No excuses for that, period,\" he said. \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" That Gray wasn't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what's known as a \"rough ride\" or \"nickel ride,\" in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around. Asked if Gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van, Batts said there is \"potential\" that both could be true. Baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into Gray's death, Batts said. They've conducted dozens of interviews, canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis, who is overseeing the task force as the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying Gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station. But on Thursday, he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop. Rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see Gray, Davis said last week. Two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot, pursuing Gray for about one-fifth of a mile, he said. \"That's where the apprehension of Freddie Gray occurred, and quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention, and he did not,\" Davis said last week. The paddy wagon carrying Gray traveled about one block before stopping, and Gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons, Davis said last week. On Thursday, Davis revealed that the van stopped again, about a mile from where police placed shackles on Gray. He did not elaborate on that stop. From there, according to the narrative Davis provided last week, the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again \"to deal with Mr. Gray, and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,\" he said. It was at that stop, Batts added, that officers lifted Gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van. Gray requested a medic during that stop, he said. The van then traveled to another incident, about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where Gray was first spotted and chased. There, a second prisoner was placed in the van, which headed back to the police department's Western District building, about a mile away, the deputy commissioner said. It was only then that an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. \"It's complex,\" Davis said of the probe. \"It involves a minutiae of details. It requires our full talents, our full time, and we're going to get this right.\" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.\n",

            "(CNN)Thousands of Syrian and Palestinian refugees trapped in the Yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities. But while the story is in itself tragic, it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling. I encountered two such individuals on my mission to Damascus -- Jihad and Mohammad -- tiny, vulnerable infants who were taken from Yarmouk in recent days, a place that was described last week by the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as \"the deepest circle of hell.\" The fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children. Looking into those bright young faces, touching their pristine hands, the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me. Like the wider Syrian conflict, Yarmouk has a human face; the faces of young Mohammad and young Jihad. I want to introduce you to them in the hope that you, too, will understand why I am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in Syria. Jihad Ya'qoub, the youngest Palestinian refugee to flee Yarmouk, was born on March 30. His mother, Said Fatima, never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough. \"I was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy, but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items,\" she said. Said Fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day. Mohammad was born in Yarmouk on January 25 of this year. When ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- entered the camp and tensions heightened, his mother, Nadia, fled in search of safety. Her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son. Yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future. She hopes that if and when life returns to normal, she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in Yarmouk. These tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all. When I next brief the Security Council, as I did a few days ago, I will tell them about Jihad and Mohammad.  I will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside Yarmouk, other civilians who need help where they are. To do this, hostilities will have to subside. Pressure must be exerted on armed actors in Yarmouk to this end. Beyond that, those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely. These things are all possible. But it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more, nothing less. Yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold. I believe they can. Because to abandon such belief would be to abandon Jihad, Mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them. And that is simply not an option.\n",

            "While Easter in the UK is celebrated with chocolate eggs and a roast lamb, in Greece they mark the day slightly differently - and a week later. As Orthodox Easter Sunday was held, thousands of homemade rockets were aimed at church towers in the Aegean island of Chios by rival parishioners in their traditional ‘mock war’. Dozens of brave souls even attend the late-night services inside the churches of Aghios Markos and Panaghia Erithiani while the annual battle is held – even when the structures and surrounding homes are ringed in defensive veils of chicken wire. Fortunately, severe injuries are rare in Vrontados during the fiery celebrations. Although small firework displays are held at churches around the country at midnight services on Easter Saturday - despite official disapproval from Church officials - Vrontados is in a league of its own, drawing spectators from all over Greece and abroad. The custom dates back to the 19th century, when the island was under Turkish occupation, but may have older roots. Preparations last all year, while on the Saturday morning participants parade their hardware through the village in lorries, honking their horns.

            "(CNN)Geography is, in part, destiny for Italy: The country will always be a bridge between Africa and Europe, as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean so starkly shows. A surge of refugees this year, usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels, has sought to reach Europe via the Libyan coast.  A boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from Libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking. Over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of Italy in the last week alone. European leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency. There is a backstory here worthy of our attention, and it has to do with Italy's colonial past. Many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of Italy's former colonies in North and East Africa, namely Eritrea (occupied from 1890-1941) and Somalia (1908-1941). As migrants, Libyans are fewer in number, but Libya (1912-1941) plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for Italy. Italy's empire never rivaled that of the British and the French in scope and longevity, but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected. Indeed, the migrants traversing the Mediterranean today form part of a century-long chain of migrations, expulsions, and exiles sparked by Italy's imperial ambition and commercial interests, the post-colonial anger of African leaders, and now mass economic desperation and political strife. Long after the formal end of Italian colonialism, these Eritreans, Somalis, and Libyans have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries. It also affects the treatment of Africans who settle in Italy. Libya is an example of the long reach of Italian imperialism. Libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of Italy, on the model of French Algeria, and Libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship's persecution of those who resisted Italian occupation. Over 100,000 Libyan men, women, and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed. Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who ruled from 1969 to 2011, was born during the Italian occupation of his country, and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as Omar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931. In 1970, soon after he took power, Gadhafi struck back, expelling the remaining Italian community in Libya. Some of those people had grown up entirely in Libya. They arrived in Italy for the first time, at some of the same ports receiving migrants today. This political intervention did not spell the end of Italian-Libyan commercial dealings, which grew out of colonial-era relations that had made Libya Italy's biggest oil supplier. Since 2004, Italy and Libya have been directly connected by the Greenstream natural gas pipeline, which runs below the Mediterranean, on the same axis as many migrant boats. Commercial concerns, and the cozy relationship of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi, also lay behind a historic 2008 Friendship Treaty between Italy and Libya, which promised infrastructure and other aid to Libya worth the equivalent of $5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by Italy during the decades of colonial rule. Until his death in 2011, despite deals with Italy and the European Union to control departures from his borders, Gadhafi intermittently used European fears of mass arrivals of migrants from Libya as a political weapon. Given Europe's geography, this weapon was pointed particularly at Italy, Libya's former master, and the principal target of Gadhafi's post-colonial revenge politics. Few Italians learn about this colonial history and its legacies, even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former Italian colonies and elsewhere are on the rise. Upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration, Cécile Kyenge, an Italian of Congolese origin, faced ugly racist attacks from fellow Italian politicians, including a comment that she looked like an orangutan. This climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the \"heroes\" of fascist imperialism. In 2012, the town of Affile built a publicly-funded memorial to General Rodolfo Graziani, known as \"the butcher of Fezzan\" for his brutal repression of Libyan resisters in the 1920s -- and for the massacre of Ethiopian civilians he ordered in response to a 1937 attempt on his life. This colonial history and its long-term consequences can help us understand Italians' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores. Italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly, and yet migrants who remain in Italy are often subject to racist attacks. It is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the Italian Navy in 2013 was the slogan of the fascist's dictatorship's bid to control the Mediterranean: Mare Nostrum. The program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to European Union budget restrictions. It seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the Italian government to its past aggressions: an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner. The Italian government deserves the full support of the European Union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis. But it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past. At 40 years old, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the Mediterranean. Setting a new course on this issue is in Italy's interest, now more than ever.\n",

            "Yaya Toure's attacking gifts aren't enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies anymore, said Gary Neville in a scathing attack on the Ivorian following Manchester City's 4-2 derby loss to United. Manuel Pellegrini's City were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against Louis van Gaal's side at Old Trafford and Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, is certain big changes are afoot for the club. 'It's a crossroads for them now,' Neville said as City drifted four points behind their third-placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off Arsenal in second. Yaya Toure's defensive lapses are costing Manchester City, claims Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville . Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness joined the chorus of criticism of the under-fire Ivorian . 'There is definitely going to be change at Manchester City, whether it's players, the manager, people above. Certainly some players. 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick. You cannot carry passengers.' Neville singled out Toure as an example of the 'weeds' at the Etihad in a scathing attack. 'He does that much for the team in an attacking sense you live with maybe the consequences of that defensively,' he said. 'But when the balance tips to a point when going forward isn't quite as effective as it once was, you've got to do something different because the defensive side is poor. Neville predicts changes at Manchester City and says the club need to get rid of 'weeds in the garden' 'If I was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you're not chasing back, you're not running around, you're not sprinting for the ball. There might be a physical problem that he cannot do it, let alone if he doesn't want to do it. I think there's definitely going to be some changes.' Graeme Souness, also on Sky Sports, even suggested the 31-year-old's work when his side doesn't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing Champions League results in recent years. Neville accused Toure of a 'complete dereliction of (his) duty' when marking Marouane Fellaini and blamed his lack of tracking back for United's third goal from Juan Mata. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday their their cross-city rivals . 'He cannot play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality,' said Neville on Sky Sports. 'Against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top, but against any team of quality you've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield. 'There are too many examples, too much evidence when watching him where he cannot do his job, simple as that. As a central midfield player in the big matches he just cannot do it.' Souness said Toure's become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate after the winger's cross found the tall Belgian for 2-1 . 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why they've not done as well as they should have done in Europe.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher pointed the finger at the City chiefs for allowing the team to get into their current state and said the fallen champions are 'gone'. The former Liverpool defender told talkSPORT: 'They’ve been a great team, but that team needs breaking up and changing. The criticism I have is for the people at the top, to have that much money and to allow yourself to get into a situation where you might need five or six players to go straight into the team. 'You look at the age of the team and it’s too old, so you need a lot of new blood. It’s going to take a lot of money. 'It’s gone for them now, physically, mentally, every part of the game. They’ve been a great team and we should applaud what they’ve achieved over the past three or four years, but it’s the end for this team now. It’s got to be broken up.' Niall Quinn, also on Sky Sports, said bluntly: 'Manchester City lost out today because he was all at sea and didn't do his defensive duties.' Toure also came in for criticism on Match of the Day 2 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain's armband at half-time. Trevor Sinclair said: 'He keeps on getting caught in no-mans land, he's not really at it, clipping the heels, and he's literally going through the motions. Trevor Sinclair and Phil Neville were both critical of City and Toure on Match of the Day 2 . 'Fellaini has completely outshone him today. He is outnumbered and I'm sure he's frustrated but again he's just going through the motions.' Picking out on particular aerial duel, which Toure lost, Sinclair said: 'This is nothing to do with ability, that's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team.' Sinclair also felt Toure was at fault for Chris Smalling's goal, United's fourth. 'He's got to organise this better,' he said. 'If you're captain of the team you've got to keep that high line, dictate and tell the lads to get in positions and win the ball. They were queuing up on the far stick.' Phil Neville said: 'The minute they concede a goal and their backs are against the wall, they crumble. They lost their shape, they lost their discipline, they were all over the place. 'There was nobody in there today that said \"right, we're going to get two banks of four, hard to beat and actually try to grind out a result\".'\n",

            "Australia’s very own nocturnal, rabbit-eared Easter mascot is under threat with bilby numbers becoming dangerously low. The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area with small populations remaining in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Kevin Bradley, CEO of Save the Bilby Fund told Daily Mail Australia that it’s very difficult to pin point the exact number of bilbies left in Australia because of their ‘cryptic’ nocturnal habits. Scroll down for video . The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area . ‘We know they are extinct in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with very few bilbies left in Queensland and scattered populations in the Northern Territory and Western Australia’ 'Things aren’t looking great and their future in the wild is very tenuous.’ In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Mr Bradley said the critters were of 'high significance to traditional land owners' with record of bilby populations dating back '15 million years'. Until recently, Australia had two species of Bilbies- the Greater Bilby and the Lesser Bilby. The Lesser Bilby is already believed to be extinct while the Greater Bilby is classed as ‘endangered’ in Queensland and ‘vulnerable’ nationally. In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Predators like feral cats and foxes are the biggest threat to the bilby populations while other contributing factors include farm animals destroying bilby habitat and introduced species like rabbits competing with them for food and burrows. Mr Bradley said foxes and feral cats are ‘desimating the population.’ The Australian Wildlife Conservancy said feral cats are the driving force behind the dramatic decline of wildlife across the country with the feral felines killing an estimated 75 million native animals every night. 'I think people are starting to recognise that these animals are having such a devastating effect on many native animal populations.' Mr Bradley said the Federal Government has committed to a National Feral Animal Summit this year that will  focus on creating a plan to address the feral cat issue. In the mean time, the Save the Bilby Fund have developed a captive breeding program and believe that continuing breeding efforts in controlled environments could be they key to saving the endangered marsupial. The Greater Bilby is a nocturnal marsupial with a silky grey and white coat and a long black and white tail. Bilbies have large ears, a long snouts and a great sense of smell that helps them locate food. The bilby is omnivorous and eats bulbs, fruit, seeds, fungi, insects, worms, termintes and even small lizards or spiders. They don’t need regular water because, like koalas, they get most of their water from their food.

            "The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, is attempting to regain control of a spaceship that is spinning out of control in orbit. Progress M-27M appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 am EDT (07:09 GMT) from  Kazakhstan. It was due to dock with the ISS six hours after take off, but that plan has now been 'indefinitely abandoned'. Scroll down for video . Nasa's reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate' 'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control. Orbital parameters were due to be sent from a Russian Ground Site, allowing for a eight 'rendevous burns' to be performed over the next five hours of flight. But, once Progress had arrived on orbit, only confirmation of its solar array deployment and some of the navigational antennas were made.

'No confirmation of navigational antenna deploy or of the pressurisation of the manifold system for the propulsion system on the spacecraft was received.' Russian spacecraft, including those used to send astronauts to the ISS, recently have acquired the capability to take a more direct six-hour route to the orbiting outpost. But they still have the option of the longer, traditional route lasting two days. 'The crew on board the International Space Station has pressed ahead with maintenance work today as well as biomedical experiment activities,' said Navias. Roscosmos' problems began shortly after a Russian Soyuz 2-1A rocket launched the latest Progress resupply vehicle to the ISS. 'Almost immediately after spacecraft separation, a series of telemetry problems were detected with the Progress 59,' Navias said during a televised broadcast from Nasa's Mission Control . Roscosmos will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over Russian ground stations. Docking with the ISS has been abandoned . It was unclear how long Progress could keep orbiting the Earth while Russian flight controllers tried to stabilise the craft and restore the system that allows them to send and receive data. Roscosmos will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over Russian ground stations. Because of the loss of connection, the flight controllers were unable to confirm the deployment of the navigational antennas needed for docking, a duty officer at Russia's Mission Control said. Progress is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo, including fuel, equipment, oxygen and food, to the space station, which currently has a six-person crew from Russia, the United States and Italy. The dizzying footage (pictured), which was taken from the Progress 59 spacecraft, shows the Earth and sun moving in and out of the frame .

The cargo ship also is delivering a copy of the Banner of Victory, the banner raised over the Reichstag in Berlin by victorious Soviet soldiers in 1945. Russia is planning extensive celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Nasa is now having to rely on a single cargo shipper, SpaceX. Its other supplier, Orbital Sciences, is still grounded following a launch explosion last October at Virginia.

Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: \"At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs.\" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. \"Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital.\" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that \"the website\" was accurate. A doctor's capacity declaration stated that Mitchell will likely be unable, due to her medical condition, to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months. Adoring fans are posting their tributes to Mitchell at WeLoveYouJoni.com. Sonya Hamasaki and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.\n",

            "Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive . Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua . Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning . Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.\n",

            "(CNN)When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.\n",

            "A couple from Texas who celebrated their wedding in 2012 claim their photographer wrote hurtful racial slurs on the bottom of photo booth snapshots from the event. The couple, who does not wish to be identified, hired attorney Cathy Hale to sue James Evans the owner of Premiere Photos for allegedly providing a photo booth that printed, 'Poor N***** Party' on the bottom of the pictures. The couple wasn't alerted of the photos until many months after the celebration when the bride's sister told the family about the racist incident at the photo booth the couple rented for the party. Scroll down for video . Racial slur: This racial slur was allegedly printed by Premiere Photos at the bottom of some of the photographs at their wedding event in 2012 . Denies allegations: James Evans who runs Premiere Photo allegedly didn't apologize for the racial slur and told the couple to 'sue' him . Attorney Cathy Hale who is representing the couple said that the sister of the bride  waited to tell her about what happened until after the wedding because she didn't want to ruin her special day or upset her. 'She made the wise decision not to tell her and spoil that specific day,' Hale told Click2Houston. Hale says that when the husband heard about the photos at the wedding he was horrified and called James Evans of Premiere Photo. The groom claims Evans  didn't even apologize. 'Sue me,' James Evan's reportedly replied. Hale told Click2Houston that her clients didn't want to file a lawsuit but they finally decided to press charges after Evans 'did nothing' about the racist comments.

When Eyewitness News reached out to Evans and his attorney, Christine Kirchner, they declined an on-camera interview but gave the same responses they gave in civil court. Venue: The couple had their wedding party at beautiful Bell Tower in northwest Houston, Texas . Evans has denied all allegations and claimed that at a party of 100 people, there is no evidence linking the company to the offensive caption. Evans also said the married couple gave 'no sign of any mental anguish.' Hale disagrees and says her clients want an apology at the very least. Mediation is scheduled for tomorrow morning but if the parties don't reach an agreement then the case is set for trial in July. They just want an apology: The couple's lawyer said that at the very least her client wants an apology from James Evans of Premiere Photos and that it isn't about money .\n",

            "The stylist behind singer Rita Ora's unique, over-the-top hairstyles has revealed how much work the chart-topper has to put into ensuring her blonde locks remain totally healthy. Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: \"I think it's time.\" 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I’m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'\n",

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also threw a first pitch, at Fenway Park in Boston - but didn't do himself proud, chucking the ball straight at the ground. The NYPD families were joined by Mayor Bill de Blasio at a time when his relationship with the police department is again coming under scrutiny. Scroll down for video .

Taya Kyle gets a hug from San Diego Padres starting pitcher Andrew Cashner after throwing out the first ceremonial pitch . De Blasio's relations with the police unions and some rank-and-file officers were fractured in the aftermath of the December shooting that claimed the lives of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide. Since that crisis, which threatened to overwhelm the mayor's agenda, de Blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation's largest police force, brokering a new union contract, investing in new technology and training, and doubling down on his public praise of the department. On Monday, he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers' images were displayed on the park's giant video screens and again when Ramos' two sons and Liu's widow threw out the pitches to Mets players David Wright, Matt Harvey and Curtis Granderson. De Blasio, however, was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd. A year ago, de Blasio was also booed as he threw out the first pitch (a strike). Both years, he sported a Mets cap and jersey, which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6, a tribute to Rico Petrocelli, a longtime shortstop on de Blasio's favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. Petrocelli, like de Blasio, was also of Italian descent and lived in Brooklyn. The tribute to the NYPD comes as de Blasio is weighing a City Council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers. The idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low. But de Blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago, pointing to the city's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere. Members of the Liu and Ramos families are greeted by New York Mets' Matt Harvey, left, David Wright, fourth from left, and Curtis Granderson, right, after throwing out the ceremonial first pitch . Members of the Liu and Ramos families, including Yenjian Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen, second from left, throw out the ceremonial first pitch . Police Commissioner William Bratton has, at times, signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department, which now has a headcount of about 34,500, about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001. De Blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago. The council's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers, to total 1,000, would cost nearly $69m in the upcoming fiscal year. But the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime.

With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner . Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike . Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match . The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan. Johansen came close at the other end with a chip which Fox tipped over the bar, after the Norwegian had weaved his way through the Jags defence.\n",

The American owner is scheduled to fly across the Atlantic for the grandest occasion during his tenure since Villa’s 2010 League Cup final against Manchester United in the same stadium. Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner will attend their FA Cup semi-final with Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday . The American has hardly seen Villa play in person during his nine-year ownership of the club . Christian Benteke, who scored for Villa against Spurs on Saturday, will be hoping to fire them to the final . Lerner, while watching games via stream in New York, has hardly seen Villa play in person in recent years, after acquiring the club in 2006. When he attended Arsenal’s visit to Villa Park in September it was his first home match since December 2012. Lerner has been publicly trying to sell Villa since last May, and is hopeful of concluding a deal worth around £150million once the season is finished.\n",

            "Kell Brook could have had the blockbuster fight he craves against Amir Khan instead of treading water against Frankie Gavin, if only his promoter had minded his words. Now that Battle of Britain – potentially at Wembley Stadium – may never take place. So says Khan's father Shah as his son gets ready to finally confirm the over-criticised Chris Algieri as his opponent in New York on the same night when Brook will be defending his world welterweight title against Gavin at London's O2 Arena on May 20 . Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) stands behind Kell Brook (left) and Frankie Gavin at the O2 Arena . Amir Khan celebrates his victory over Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas last year . Shah Khan, who also supervises affairs, says: 'Kell could have had his chance against Amir right now if Eddie Hearn had toned it down. But instead of being patient he's been so disrespectful. 'If he carries on like that the Brook fight will not take place. He keeps shouting about how much the fight is worth but I don't care about the money. For Amir it's more about the big fights and his status in boxing. 'Amir's told Kell he will be happy to box him in the next year but Eddie's jeopardising that. He carries on calling us out and insulting us. Any more of that and it will be all over. 'Kell has said plenty, too. But we don't think this is his fault. He seems a good lad. It's Eddie putting the words in his mouth.' Initially, Hearn's provocative manoeuvres came as a surprise to the rival camp. Khan Snr says: 'Eddie will talk reasonably in the negotiating room. Pleasant with us. But as soon as he gets outside he starts with the nonsense.' Hearn (centre) speaks during a press conference to announce the fight between Brook and Gavin . Khan (right) poses for a photo alongside father Shah (centre) and brother Haroon in Sheffield in 2013 . The Khans see a telling parable with the way Junior Witter's critical harassment of Ricky Hatton offended the Hitman. 'Ricky became annoyed and it was hard to blame him,' says Shah. 'It was a fight he would have been happy to take but when the words became unpleasant he walked away for good. 'And what's happened to Witter after that? Virtually nothing. Now he's more less forgotten. I can see the same happening to Kell. 'Yet Brook is a fight Amir would have been more than happy to have. We feel it's a fairly comfortable fight for us. Kell has done OK but we sense that as soon as he comes up against a fighter of Amir's elite level he will be found out. 'Eddie needs to calm down.' If what is being described as the biggest domestic fight in waiting is to become reality, it is over to you Mr Hearn. Eddie, a fellow columnist here at Sportsmail, has pushed through a number of matches with his outspoken pubic challenges. But last week he drew a frosty response from Carl Frampton and his legendary promoter Barry McGuigan when he brandished at them a cheque for £1.5million for the Belfast Jackal to meet his man Scott Quigg in a world super-bantamweight title unification fight. Brook (left) and Gavin (right) go face to face as promoter Hearn looks on in the background . Hearn displays the cheque for £1.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Khan has taken flak for lining up Algieri for his next fight, after the New Yorker was decked six times en route to an embarrassing, wipe-out defeat by Manny Pacquaio. But Algieiri did defeat the previously feared Russian puncher Ruslan Provodnikov to win the world lightweight title, which he still holds. And Khan says: 'Gavin hasn't done anything to compare with that. Sadly Frankie's recent performances against comparatively weak opposition have been anything but convincing. Good luck to him getting the pay-night but he's done nothing to justify this world title shot.' Khan jumped the gun in announcing Algieri and the May 20 date at the Barclays Center in New York, since his advisor Al Haymon was still finalising the deal. Chris Algieri (left) takes on Manny Pacquiao in a WBO welterweight title bout in Macau last year . But all seems to be in place now and the official statement should come this week. Khan was criticised, also, for allegedly declining the IBF offer of a final eliminator against Tim Bradley for Brook's belt. Khan Snr says: 'We couldn't really see the point of an eliminator a fight which Brook is so desperate to have.' His son was also accused of being less than truthful for saying he knew nothing about the offer. But there are suggestions that the secretive Haymon dismissed the IBF offer out of hand, without informing Khan. Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch. Paul Smith (right) throws a punch towards Arthur Abraham during their title fight in Berlin in February . Virgil Hunter, California-based trainer of both Ward and Amir Khan, says: 'Smith is who we want and I'm told it's a done deal. But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions – Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' – to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US. Ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as London, not to Nottingham where Froch has long desired to box on his hometown City Ground. Andre Ward (left) poses with his many title belts after defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November 2013 . Hunter declares: 'Andre would have gladly taken Carl straight away.' But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco. Froch, meanwhile, is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the Las Vegas Strip, against the namesake son of Mexican legend Julio Cesar Chavez. Step into Oakland's Oracle Arena, Paul Smith. Good luck to him, in every sense of the phrase.

            "Julie Walter, 49, who has been jailed for two and a half years after posing as trusted officials to dupe elderly residents in sheltered housing out of money . A woman has been branded a 'menace to the community' after she posed as both a council warden and a church official to bluff her way into sheltered housing complexes to steal from vulnerable residents. Julie Walters, 49, has been jailed for two and a half years after she pretended to be a trusted official to dupe elderly victims out of cash. She was caught by police after she was spotted on CCTV loitering in the communal hall of a retirement property near to the Old Trafford football ground in Manchester before an 80-year-old man and an 81-year-old woman were fleeced in two separate attacks. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters of Withington, Manchester, hanging around outside the complex after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court. The court heard how the first victim, a man aged 81, was targeted at about midday on February 25 this year when he was walking back to his sheltered accommodation. He saw Walters get out of a taxi and she asked him for money, claiming she needed to pay the taxi and then go into town. Mistakenly thinking she was one of the wardens, he gave her about £30 in cash. The next day she returned to the man’s address, claiming she worked there, and needed to check his bathroom. After tricking her way inside, she stole his wallet and £100 in cash. Walters struck again on March 2 at the home of an 80-year-old man who lives at another retirement home. She falsely claimed she was from the church which convinced the man to let her inside. Walters then rifled through the kitchen, stealing his wallet containing between £50 to £60 in cash. Later that day and at the same retirement home, Walters targeted the home of an 81-year-old woman, claiming she was from 'the council' and needed to use the toilet. Once inside, she stole a £5 note from the woman’s handbag but was caught red-handed. When confronted she simply put the note on the coffee table and left. Walters was identified on the CCTV footage by a beat police officer and she was arrested on March 4. Investigations showed she had booked taxis to drop her off and then pick her up at times and locations matching those of the three burglaries. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters hanging around outside a complex, where she targeted two residents, after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court . After the case Detective Sergeant Rachel Smith of Greater Manchester Police said: “Walters is devoid of conscience and scruples. “She is also extremely manipulative, not only in terms of tricking her way into the homes of vulnerable people but also targeting those she thinks are too frail or elderly to recognise her or give evidence in court. “In fact, in this case, one of the victims did feel he was too old to go to court but thankfully the woman who caught her red-handed positively picked her out of an identity parade and that, combined with the CCTV and mobile phone evidence we found, created an overwhelming case against Walters. “I cannot overstate what a menace to the community Walters is but thanks to this excellent investigation, she is now starting a lengthy jail sentence and the streets are much safer with her behind bars. “I would also like to commend the victims for giving their statements despite some reservations about their age. 'By doing so, they have not only helped effect justice for themselves but also saved other potential victims a great deal of heartache.”\n",

Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp oversees training on Thursday ahead of this weekend's match . On TV scheduling, Wenger said: 'Something should be done. I'm surprised they don't analyse it in the TV deals. I'm surprised a game of the same stature is played at the same time. There's a little conflict there. It's difficult to understand.' 'We would like it to be a unique competition that's played, especially a semi-final or final and don't want it to be conflicting with other competitions. It's a very big game (at Chelsea). It's a surprise to me.' Wenger admits a United win at Chelsea could open up the title race again. 'Mathematically yes,' he said. 'But we have to keep winning.' Klopp confirmed on Wednesday his intention to leave Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in which the club won two Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final. It sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether the charismatic 47-year-old might be destined for England with Arsenal or Manchester City, where manager Manuel Pellegrini is feeling the heat after a poor run of form. Wenger hit out at the TV scheduling as Manchester United's trip to Chelsea clashes with the semi-final . Wenger has branded the 'circus' around Jurgen Klopp's resignation as 'ridiculous' 'I'm not an agency to place managers,' said Wenger, when asked about Klopp's announcement. 'I like every manager and respect, everybody. I find that circus a bit ridiculous. 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund. Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, they have the ability to keep their best players. They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Arsenal will have Jack Wilshere available for the semi-final against Reading, as he trained on Thursday with the club at their base. Wojciech Szczesny will start in the tie, and was also put through his paces during Arsenal's training session. The Gunners boss says his team have learned from last season, when they fell behind at this stage against Wigan and needed penalties to beat the Championship side. 'It's my 10th semi-final and that means we know how to prepare but it's always tricky,' he added. 'We learned from Wigan last year. It's always a special occasion to share with our fans. We want them to go home happy.' Wenger confirmed that second-choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny will start at Wembley on Saturday . Szczesny will start for Wenger on Saturday when Arsenal try to book their place in the FA Cup final . Jack Wilshere, who played against Reading U21s this week, will be fit to face the Championship side .

Tomasz Lazar spent hours photographing and interviewing adults who were ripped from their homes as children in the 1940s and forced to live thousands of miles away in Siberia. \"For me those faces are like maps,\" Lazar said. \"The more you look at them, the more you are discovering.\" Soviet authorities invaded Poland during World War II and deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. Some were sent to prison camps in the frozen wilderness of central Russia. Many were children. In effect, Moscow stole much of an entire generation of young Poles, a handful of whom Lazar has located seven decades later. During Lazar's interviews, many of the survivors broke down in tears. \"It was very traumatic for them,\" he said. \"Some lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters -- killed by the Soviets.\" Lazar remembers hearing 84-year-old Boguslaw Dokurno recall his grandfather's dying wish. Dokurno's grandfather asked his grandson to return home to Poland after his death to retrieve Polish soil and bring it back to his Siberian gravesite. Another exile, Sofia Bocian, told Lazar how her brother escaped their prison camp, leaving her with the horrifying experience of being interrogated by Soviet secret police. Lazar began his professional photography career in 2006 after fully realizing the medium's storytelling power. \"For me when you're doing photography -- whether it's conventional journalism or other types -- you want to share something with people,\" he said. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Lazar said the interviews surprised him. Despite his subjects' traumatic experiences, \"they welcomed me with open arms,\" he recalled. \"They really wanted to share their stories.\" Fearing for their safety, they couldn't tell their stories publicly until the fall of the Soviet Union. Now that they're in their 80s, time is running out for them to document their struggles. Look at Lazar's images. The faces fill each frame. Each portrait is unique. Before taking each photo, he waited \"for the moment when they really started going inside themselves,\" he said. \"Those people are really strong in their souls.\" Their stories should be documented for history, he said, to remind future generations \"not to make the same mistakes.\" Tomasz Lazar is a Polish photographer.

            "The baby boom generation is set to leave a wave of funeral debt to its children and grandchildren, a report warns. The number of deaths every year in Britain – which have been falling for the past 40 years – will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as the lives of unprecedented numbers born in the post-baby boom come to an end. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Loss of baby boomers: The number of UK deaths per will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past ten years . The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ Expensive end: A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, an old age think tank has found . It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.\n",

            "The biggest pension reforms in a century have been met with confusion as customers as young as 23 try to cash in their retirement savings. Pension firms said Britons remained baffled about how the radical changes worked, with many unaware of age restrictions or tax implications. Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity. And yesterday, the first people to cash in their pots began to receive their money. Scroll down for video . Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity . The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings – unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party. But experts said barring TV adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers, some of whom were already confused by the changes. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable  if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can cash in their pensions and spend them  instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image) David Trenner, of Intelligent Pensions, said it was 'crazy to stop advertising Pension Wise under Purdah rules', while Catriona Standingford, who runs a financial training firm, asked on Twitter: Shouldn't the consumer/taxpayer come first?.' The Treasury said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for April and most of May. Pensions firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone. But several calls a day have been from people under-55 trying to access their cash, including a 23-year-old who mistakenly believed they could 'get hold of their pot now'. Richard Parkin, of Fidelity, said: 'Misunderstandings exist around when you can access your funds. 'Since the new freedoms were announced, we've received a steady number of calls from people under the age of 55 who think they can access their funds under the new rules.'\n",

            "Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A border guard was killed in a cross-boundary fire exchange with militants in Yemen this week, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday -- marking Saudi Arabia's first publicly known military death since it launched airstrikes against rebels inside its southern neighbor. The clash occurred Wednesday night at the border in southwestern Saudi Arabia's Asir region, when militants in a mountainous area on the Yemeni side fired on Saudi border troops, prompting them to return fire, SPA reported. Besides the slain border guard -- identified as Cpl. Salman Ali Yahya al-Maliki -- 10 others suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, the Saudi media outlet said. On Thursday, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, a neutral security official and two Houthi commanders in Aden told CNN. The palace had been where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. According to the security official, Houthis now control most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. Yemeni special forces, considered pro-Houthi and loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, arrived in Aden on Thursday in an attempt \"to secure the city,\" a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation told CNN. \"I can now confirm that it is not Saudi special forces who have landed but Yemeni special forces loyal to Saleh who landed by small boat. They are few in number and have made their way to the old parliament building,\" the intelligence official said. U.S. Navy warships, meanwhile, were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The Navy on Wednesday came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a \"vessel of interest\" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Marie Claire Feghali, an International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman in Sanaa, described events in Aden as \"extremely fluid and very, very complicated.\" \"Hospitals are still struggling, running out of supplies. So are we,\" she said. \"We cannot move much in Aden due to the intense fighting and chaos.\" A hospital near heavy fighting was forced to shut down. Officials: Al Qaeda fighters free 270 from Yemeni prisons . CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.\n",

            "Mark Hughes has revealed talks have opened over a contract extension for in-demand Asmir Begovic following Stoke's 2-1 win over Southampton. The Bosnian goalkeeper, who kept Stoke in the game during a one-sided first half at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday, sees his existing deal run out next year with Real Madrid known admirers. And speaking after second-half goals from Mame Diouf and substitute Charlie Adam saw his side roar back after Morgan Schneiderlin had given Ronald Koeman’s Southampton a deserved lead, manager Hughes added that he was hopeful of keeping Begovic at the club. Stoke City have opened talks over a contract extension for in-demand goalkeeper Asmir Begovic . Begovic is highly-rated and has attracted interest from several top clubs, including La Liga's Real Madrid . Stoke boss Mark Hughes is keen to keep Begovic at the club as he looks to stabilise them in the top ten . Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam scores during the comeback win over Southampton in the Premier League . Jonathan Walters (left) congratulates fellow Stoke striker Mame Biram Diouf (right) after his goal on Saturday . ‘We want to be a team that’s consistently in the top ten,’ said a beaming Hughes whose side rose to ninth in the table. ‘To be able to do that you need key players in key areas of the field and obviously goalkeeper is a key position in any good team and Asmir has been exceptional for us for a long time now.’ Both Manchester clubs have watched the 27-year-old but Hughes thinks Stoke have a chance of persuading him to stay. The win over Southampton on Saturday was Stoke’s first over them since February 2008 when an own goal from Darren Powell and efforts from Ryan Shawcross and Mamady Sidibe secured a 3-2 triumph. ‘We’re talking and those talks are going to be concluded in the summer,’ he said. ‘Hopefully they are going to be concluded in our favour.’ Next up for Saints, who missed the chance to close the gap on Manchester City in fourth place to two points, is a home meeting with Tottenham - and the return to St Mary’s of former boss Mauricio Pochettino. Captain Jose Fonte believes it is a big match because of the race for Europe rather than the visit of the Argentine. ‘It’s because it’s Tottenham,’ said the centre-half. ‘They are close in the table and we want to finish above them. Obviously, there’s that added bit that Pochettino is coming back, but for us players it’s just another big game against a team that is next to us that we want to beat.’ Southampton defender Jose Fonte (left) competes for the ball with Diouf (right) at the Britannia Stadium .\n",

            "Andros Townsend admitted he had devoted plenty of thought to his cheeky retaliation against Paul Merson. ‘That tweet has been going over in my head,’ said Townsend, who followed up his spectacular equaliser in Italy by hitting Twitter to strike back at criticism from the former Arsenal and England midfielder. ‘As soon at the goal went in, I was just desperate to get that tweet out. I’m eagerly awaiting his response. I haven’t seen it yet. Andros Townsend scores England's equaliser in their 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday night . Townsend celebrates his strike with Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Ryan Mason (left) and Kyle Walker . In his column for skysports.com, Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn’t get in the squad?' ‘He said when the squad was announced that I should be “nowhere near the squad”. It didn’t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I’ve done that as I always have.’ Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: ‘Not bad for a player that should be “nowhere near the squad” ay @PaulMerse?’ The Tottenham’s winger’s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: “Oh ye of little faith #Merson get in.’ They could also have pointed out that Townsend’s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. ‘You can never stop proving things to people,’ said Townsend. ‘But I think every time I’ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson’s point. Townsend’s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. ‘I can’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,’ admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. ‘The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s my best form but this is the best form I’ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I’m over the worst of that. ‘I’m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.’ After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. ‘He is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,’ said Townsend. ‘As soon as the whistle went, I thought I’d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.’ Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break .\n",

            "The casket of promising basketball player Lauren Hill has been moved into the 10,000-seater arena where she made her first basket in a college game just five months ago. The 19-year-old defied doctors' expectations after she was diagnosed with a rare form of inoperable brain cancer just after her 18th birthday. She was told she would not live past December but died four months later this month after playing with her college team at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati to raise $1.5million for research into childhood cancer. Scroll down for video . The casket of  basketball player Lauren Hill was placed at the site where she made her first basket five months ago, before she died of an inoperable brain tumour this month. Her high school team mates gathered to remember her at a memorial today in the arena where she scored her first basket for her college team . Today mourners at the arena celebrated her life and determination in the face of the obstacles she overcame in her short life. Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma after she became dizzy following a basketball game with her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The tumour is found on the brain stem and can cause double vision and difficulty controlling facial expressions. Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December. The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:\" What am I doing with my life?\" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. \"How can I be a better person?\" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial . Hill's high school basketball team, the Lawrenceburg Tigers, carried her jersey and a net into the memorial . Memorabilia from Hill's basketball career including a ball, net and her jersey, were placed by the casket . The public memorial was held at Xavier University in Cincinnati, with Hill's casket decorated with flowers . Mr and Mrs Hill (right) followed the casket at the conclusion of the hour-long memorial service in Cincinnati . The arena was packed for the game, which started with a set play to get her a left-handed layup. She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 — her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs — Katy Perry's 'Roar' — was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million — matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati . The fundraising campaign will continue through the school and the foundation. A number of people have praised the teenager's courage and determination as she battled her condition. 'Lauren chose to be the victor,' said the Reverend Corey Potts from her church in Indiana. 'When she was in the hospital, I went to see Lauren expecting to cheer her up. And she cheered me up.'

            "This year has seen a rash of massive dust storms around the world that have led to travel chaos and blocked out sunlight - but experts cannot pinpoint the reason behind the spate. This week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual 'apocalyptic' dust storm, known in Arabic as a haboob, struck Belarus, turning day to night, and China has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year. Some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms, but one European scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable. Dark clouds start forming over the city of Soligorsk, Belarus, as a sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . A raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city . The footage of the dust storm in Belarus, filmed from a high rise apartment, shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, reported RT. Earlier this month Britain was shrouded in a cloud of Saharan dust, known as 'blood rain,' as the temperatures soared. Blurred: The Shard, one of London's most iconic buildings, is pictured shrouded in 'blood rain' earlier this month . In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm (pictured) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude . Dr Steven Godby, a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at Nottingham Trent University, explained how these events can occur. 'The dust is produced from source areas in North Africa, incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the UK. 'However, the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources. And incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of April showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms  devoured a city in China's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north-west of the country being the fourth this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. On April 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. The Middle East has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year. This week Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran experienced severe dust storms and last week the Arabian Peninsula was hit by a sandstorm the size of the U.S. And in February raging sandstorms engulfed Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt causing the worst Israeli air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the Mediterranean Sea. The sandstorm hit Egypt after unusually warm and sunny weather for a February day, and the sky over downtown Cairo turned yellow and blotted out the sun, limiting visibility . Hazy: The Egyptian capital was transformed by the sandstorm while Alexandria and nearby Dekheila ports were closed because of the weather . Red alert: The sandstorm in Egypt gave the country a Martian look . The storm, made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa also engulfed Cairo. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years. The sandstorm that engulfed the Arabian Peninsula, meanwhile, wrecked havoc across the area, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agulló, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them. He said: ‘We are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring, mainly from satellites, and forecast systems, in the last five to 10 years, and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions, in recent decades, increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes.’ He added: ‘Our longest dust records over the North Atlantic, downwind from the Sahara desert, which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes, but we don't really see positive trends.’ Severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in Egypt's capital city . 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world’s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agulló, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them.

            "FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein has made a formal rotation of the World Cup between the continents one of the key elements of his manifesto and says he can see a tournament being jointly hosted by several different nations. Prince Ali, a current FIFA vice-president from Jordan, said he could envisage a World Cup being played in different countries - or even in different confederations - in a similar way to Euro 2020 which is being played in 13 nations. In his manifesto, which he launched on Monday, Prince Ali has also warned against any decision on expanding the World Cup from its current 32 countries, or a re-allocation of places, being taken for purely political reasons to try to drum up votes for the FIFA presidency. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, a FIFA presidential candidate, wants to see the World Cup rotated between nations . Prince Ali, who aims to replace  Sepp Blatter (right), warned against expanding the World Cup from 32 teams . Prince Ali is standing for FIFA president alongside former Portugal and Real Madrid player Luis Figo . He is standing against current president Sepp Blatter, Michael van Praag from Holland and former Portugal international Luis Figo. In terms of World Cup rotation, Prince Ali said the confederations should take turns hosting the tournament. 'The principle is that it should be rotated among the confederations but it still has to be based on the best bids,' he said. 'But we have to be open-minded. I think it is also possible that two countries from different confederations could co-host the World Cup. Look at Europe in 2020 - a number of different regions or countries could host the World Cup - it's in the past now but potentially the Gulf could have had a World Cup due to its close proximity.' FIFA has announced it will make a decision on the allocation of World Cup places at an executive committee meeting the day after the presidential election on May 29. Prince Ali said much more consultation was needed before any decision should be made. He added: 'I am very hesitant about people playing politics with the most important flagship event of FIFA and possibly of sport in the world. 'We need to speak to all the stakeholders, including the sponsors. People are making promises to enlarge the World Cup but in 2022 they are making the World Cup shorter in terms of time frame. We cannot end up with a situation where mistakes are made again.' Prince Ali has also promised greater transparency, including making public the salary of the FIFA president and executive committee members. He also believes that the minutes of FIFA executive committee meetings should be made public. He also wants an investigation into how the US television rights for the 2026 World Cup were awarded to Fox without a tender process or any discussion with the FIFA executive committee. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said FIFA 'did what it had to do' to prevent any possible legal action from the broadcaster in relation to the 2022 rights after the Qatar World Cup was moved to the winter. Prince Ali, who insists there is a real appetite for change among FIFA associations, said large sums of money for football had potentially been lost. 'Unfortunately I was not made aware of it and I have been trying to find out what is going on,' he said. Michael van Praag (right), from Holland, is the remaining presidential candidate . 'Something went wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it. 'It needs to have a proper tendering process which is good practice in any organisation in the world. 'We are talking about a large sum of money that future generations will potentially have lost because of decisions or misadministration taking place at the moment by people who will probably not be around at that time.'\n",

            "You'd think that being a chef, I'd want to escape the toils of the kitchen while on holiday - but the opposite is true. I jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration. And where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious Grenada? The island is known for its zesty spices and self-sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk. Heading west: Rosemary spent a week on Grenada, where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available . Meat and fish are plentiful and, because the soil is very fertile, the vegetables, fruit and salads are the glossiest you'll ever see. Grenada's seasons are similar to our own, which means cauliflower, broccoli and pumpkins in spring. Exotic fruit - mangoes, star fruit, passion fruit, melon and skin-up, which is like a lychee — are the stars of the summer. Autumn heralds guavas, sweetsop (sugar apples) and soursop (similar to pawpaw), and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple, which is a Caribbean version of a peach. Sumptuous sands: Grenada is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of Grand Anse . I am staying in the southwest of the island at Mount Cinnamon on Grand Anse Beach, near the charming town of St George. It offers well-equipped self-catering villas, each with its own terrace and wonderful views of the bay. You can cook your own supper, but the bubbling restaurant scene is difficult to resist. Beach bars abound. I especially liked the Beach Cabana at Mount Cinnamon, where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night. People come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach, at which local musicians play. This is the Caribbean at its best. Just beware of those generous drinks measures. The restaurant Yolo (which is text speakfor 'you only live once') specialises in sushi and Asian cuisine. I order plums, mangoes, cherries and avocados, all picked that day. The fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare, its signature dish, almost leaps off the plate. Come dine with me: Grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes . The next day, I watch a fish cookery demonstration at Mount Cinnamon: a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut, ginger, lime, spices, peppers and chives, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire, and served with delicious breadfruit chips. If you want to mingle with Grenadans, there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market. St George's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island. In a 17th-century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit, exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory. Here, I learn to cook the Grenadan national dish, oil down. This is a hearty, one-pot meal with salted meat, chicken, breadfruit, callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings. The whole lot is stewed in coconut milk. Delicious! The food odyssey continues in the evening when I visit BB's Crabback Caribbean restaurant, overlooking the harbour. My favourite place to eat on the beach is La Sagesse, on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath-temperature sea. A place to cool your heels: Rosemary stayed at Grenada's elegant Mount Cinnamon resort . No tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the River Antione Rum Distillery - the last one in the Caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar, as they did in the 18th century. Rum is not to my taste, but it's interesting to see the process behind it. Belmont in the Grand Etang area is more to my liking. It's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm. We taste goat's cheese and salt fish fritters, a popular local dish. Even the governor grows her own vegetables. Her Excellency Dame Cecile la Grenade is the first woman governor on the island. She received an OBE from the Queen for the food business started by her mother. Her extensive gardens are full of exotic vegetables, fruit and spices — a dream to any aspiring cook. Even the paths are made of crushed nutmeg shells. A fitting tribute to this fragrant and friendly island. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Grenada from £562 return. A one-bedroom suite at the Mount Cinnamon hotel resort & beach club (001 473 439 4400, www.mountcinnamongrenadahotel.com) starts from £265 B&B per night.\n",

            "The family of one ANZAC veteran were thrilled to receive news from a stranger this week that their relative's war medal had been unearthed in an east Melbourne Park. Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably not his either. Instead, it records the date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'\n",

            "A lion had an unfortunate accident when it got its head stuck in a feeding barrel at a zoo in the Netherlands. Captured by a visitor to the Dierenrijk zoo, the lion can be seen inserting its head into the barrel and attempting to retrieve a piece of meat. Zoo keepers place food in barrels to stimulate the lions, as it replicates the challenges faced when the animals feed in the wild. The animal, hoping to beat two other lions to the food, reaches in too far and suddenly gets its head stuck. Reacting in a panic the lion jumps backwards and attempts to flick the barrel from its head as the other lions chase after it. Visitors to the zoo can be heard laughing hysterically while the lion desperately tries to set itself free. The animal, hoping to beat two other lions to the food, reaches into the barrel too far and gets its head stuck . The other lions chase after the barrel as the distressed animal runs around in a circle and attempts to free itself . One lion appears to come to the rescue by jumping up and standing on the barrel while the lion pulls from the ground. But unfortunately the animal is unable to free its head and the other two lions walk around looking perplexed. Feeling sorry for itself, the distressed lion stands alone in the corner before turning and running frantically towards the zoo’s visitors. The lion reacts in panic and attempts to flick the barrel from its head by running around . Visitors watch on as the lion jumps around and even runs towards the people standing at the edge of the enclosure . The video concludes with the lion looking well and truly fed up as it lies on the ground, exhausted by its failed attempts to break free. According to the video maker, the lion was eventually freed from the barrel and it was unharmed. He said: ‘To make feeding a little bit more exciting for the lions they [the keepers] put meat in a barrel with two small openings. According to the video maker, the lion was eventually freed from the barrel and it was unharmed . The other lions look perplexed and one even looks as if it is trying to help its friend by standing on the barrel . ‘The lions had to get the meat out of the barrel through the holes. Instead one lion put his head through a hole and got stuck. ‘He was walking around and bumped into some objects. He became exhausted, but is basically still all right. ‘After closing time, a veterinarian came and anaesthetised the lion. The barrel was cut off and the lion did not have any injuries. He is happily walking around again.’ The video concludes with the lion looking well and truly fed up as it lies on the ground, exhausted by its failed attempts to break free .\n",

            "A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning \"strange wing\" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. ‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. ‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. ‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. ‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’\n",

            "The Duchess of Cambridge is already up to four days overdue with her second child - and her labour could now be induced this week, it was claimed today. The 33-year-old royal’s baby is expected before the end of April - with the due date initially reported as yesterday, but later claimed to actually be as early as Wednesday last week. Either way Kate - who plans to give birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced. Scroll down for video . Previous royal birth: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, in a proud moment with their newborn  son Prince George in July 2013 . Due date: Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital (pictured yesterday) for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . A source, whose children were born at the hospital’s exclusive Lindo Wing, told Daily Telegraph reporter Gordon Rayner: ‘The doctors don’t normally wait for more than a week. ‘They will probably already have been in touch with Kate, and talked about which day which suit her best to go in and be induced if the baby doesn’t arrive in the next couple of days.’ A Kensington Palace source said last week: 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date.'  Prince George was reportedly born three days late when he arrived at the hospital in July 2013. The joint favourite dates for the royal baby to be born are tomorrow and Tuesday at 6/1 - with Wednesday priced at 7/1 and Thursday 8/1, according to MailOnline's official betting partner Coral. The bookmaker is also offering evens on a morning birth, 3/1 on the baby arriving in the afternoon and 2/1 on it being in the evening – while Alice (5/4) and Charlotte (5/1) are the favourite names. Royal fan: Terry Hutt (right) waits last week for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child to be born . Cute: Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . But some punters might look further ahead for their bets - if they believe those who say labour is influenced by the lunar cycle and the arrival of a full moon. The next full moon is on May 4. The idea is the moon's gravitational pull affects the amniotic fluid in the same way it affects water in the sea and rivers. When Kate gave birth  on July 22, 2013, it was the day of a new full moon. Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Sky News today: ‘I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.’ Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted. A Danish study in February suggested inducing women at 37 weeks can lower the chance of a baby dying or developing a serious health condition.\n",

            "Real Madrid closed the gap on Barcelona to just two points at the top of La Liga, but will be praying injuries to Gareth Bale and Luka Modric don't derail their season. Both Los Blancos stars were substituted as Carlo Ancelotti's side struggled to overcome a spirited Malaga, who had chances to snatch a draw. Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty but provided goals for Sergio Ramos and James Rodriguez, before adding the third himself, as Madrid kept within touching distance of league leaders Barcelona. Sergio Ramos celebrates scoring for Real Madrid in the 24th-minute against Malaga . Real Madrid captain Ramos celebrates with his team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . James Rodriguez made it 2-0 for Real Madrid in the 69th-minute after Ronaldo had missed a penalty . Malaga then pulled one back but Ronaldo look delighted after making up for his earlier miss to make it 3-1 . Real Madrid: Casillas, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Arbeloa (Carvajal 76'), Kroos, Rodriguez, Modric (Illarramendi 60'), Isco, Ronaldo, Bale (Hernandez 5') Subs not used: Navas, Silva, Fernandez, Jese . Booked: Arbeloa, Kroos . Goals: Ramos 24' Rodriguez 69' Ronaldo 90' Malaga: Kameni, Angeleri, Roseles, Boka, Sanchez, Amrabat, Garcia, Recio (Damian Tissone 75'), Castillejo (Horta 81'), Darder (Duda 87), Juanmi . Subs not used: Guerra, Ochoa, Torres, Filipenko . Booked: Sanchez, Damian Tissone . Goals: Juanmi 71' After just four minutes, Bale's game was over. The Welshman tenderly touched his calf and made a pulling motion with his hands to the bench as he left the pitch, which might imply internal muscle damage. Given that Karim Benzema was injured after a brutal Champions League encounter with City rivals Atletico Madrid in midweek, Bale's injury took the famous \"BBC\" strikeforce just down to C. That's the grade you'd give it too, in 2015, when compared to the performances of Barcelona's trio. Isco came in for Benzema, with the Frenchman's injury solving a problem that was brewing at Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti having to choose between the former Malaga man, and James Rodriguez. The latter was chosen over the former to face Atletico, leading to stories of angst on Isco's part, but the issue was resolved by Benzema's timely absence. Modric, meanwhile, was taken out by a Recio challenge in the second half. It wasn't too fierce a tackle, but the Croatian took a strong knock to his knee and is now a doubt for Wednesday's second leg against Atletico. Malaga, having beaten Barcelona at Camp Nou earlier this season, and drawn with champions Atletico Madrid last week, are no La Liga whipping boys and they came to the Santiago Bernabeu with the belief they could win. Nordin Amrabat, on loan from Galatasaray, charged forward battling with Pepe, escaped the Real Madrid defender and crossed for Juanmi, but the forward couldn't connect and the chance was gone. The Dutchman stung Iker Casillas' fingertips with a strike from distance, the veteran stopper tipping his effort behind for a corner. Carlos Idriss Kameni was forced into a similar save at the other end, spectacularly flicking a header from Bale's replacement, Javier Hernandez, over the bar. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu . The Welsh forward was forced to go off to be replaced in the early stages of proceedings . Ramos tucks the ball in to open the scoring for Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . The defender slides on his knees in front of the Real Madrid fans after netting . Real Madrid broke the deadlock in controversial fashion, when Ronaldo fired in a free kick from the left and Ramos rammed home from close range. The defender seemed fractionally offside, but despite Kameni's cries, the goal was allowed to stand. The Cameroonian goalkeeper was called into action again shortly afterwards, making a fine save down to his right from a James volley. With the most expensive player in the world off the pitch, the second most expensive was having fun. Ronaldo pulled off a quite ridiculous backheel-nutmeg on Marcos Angeleri. In the following minute Ramos had the ball in the net again, nodding home a Toni Kroos free-kick, but this time the officials spotted he was offside and ruled it out. Malaga flew down the other end and created a magnificent opportunity, which Sergi Darder blazed over the bar when he should have found the net. Juanmi's cross was half-cleared by Marcelo and Darder pounced, but lacked balance and spooned his strike off-target from eight yards. Amrabat, flying down the right early in the second half, tried to find Juanmi with a low cross, but it flew past the forward and Casillas gathered it. Ronaldo had the perfect opportunity to put the game beyond Malaga when James was taken down in the box by Samu Castillejo, but lacked his characteristic cool and fired the penalty against the left upright.

But Real Madrid didn't have long to wait for their second, with James scoring in spectacular fashion just a minute later. He played two one-twos on the edge of the box with Isco and Ronaldo, before lashing the ball into Kameni's top right corner. Game over? Not quite. Malaga were straight down the other end and on the scoresheet, with Roberto Rosales whipping the ball in from the right for Juanmi to head home. Amrabat had a chance to run through after a Marcelo mis-step - this was a rare poor performance for the Brazilian - but Kroos resorted to a blatant kick to stop him. The German went into the book, with the foul a symbol of how Madrid were struggling to prevent the Andalusian side from getting forward on the break. Ronaldo saw his second-half penalty hit the post after Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni had gone the right way . Real Madrid forward Ronaldo looks frustrated after missing a penalty during the second half . But Rodriguez soon doubled Real Madrid's lead just a couple of minutes after Ronaldo had missed the penalty . Ronaldo celebrates after securing the 3-1 victory late on after Malaga had pulled one back . Ronaldo's evening was saved on a personal level at the end, with Hernandez selflessly squaring the ball for the forward to tap home at the far post. His celebration was excessive, considering Madrid had essentially won the game and it was a simple finish, but that's what happens when you have to keep up with the Joneses. Or in this case, the Messis. The Argentine had scored for Barcelona earlier, so Ronaldo would have left frustrated had he not been able to replicate Messi's effort, grabbing his 39th goal of the season in La Liga, and his 50th in all competitions. Ronaldo became the first ever player to net 50 goals in five consecutive seasons, an incredible statistic, but Ancelotti's mind will now turn to Wednesday night and another incredible statistic. He has faced Atletico Madrid seven times so far this season and not won a single game. Will he be forced to try it without Modric and Bale in the eighth?\n",

But this isn't the real Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Instead, it's their puppet likenesses - commissioned for ITV's new comedy spoof show, Newzoids. And the Duke and Duchess aren't the only royals to get a puppet makeover. Their dolls will be joined by an even more amusing version of Prince Harry, as well as a roster of celebrities. Scroll down for video . Plastic princess: The Duchess of Cambridge is about to make her debut in puppet form . The show, which has been likened to 1980s behemoth Spitting Image, starts later this month and, according to makers Citrus TV, will offer a similarly light-hearted take on current affairs. Sketches set to feature in the opening show include one that sees David Cameron slug it out with Nick Clegg on a puppet version of The Jeremy Kyle Show. Another sketch will see Ed Miliband's effigy join Ant and Dec to star in a show called 'I'm a Catastrophe... Get Me Out of Here' while a third will see Professor Brian Cox unearthing a new planet - on Kim Kardashian's backside. The six-part series will also feature Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles and The Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. Star of the show: Prince William's puppet is ready for the launch of new series, Newzoids . The real thing: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Stephen Lawrence Centre in south London . Royal stars: The Duke and Duchess will appear alongside Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall . The new show represents the first time that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have found themselves lampooned in a comedy show. But while it will all be new to William and Kate, other members of the Royal Family will remember their starring roles in Spitting Image. Among the most memorable was the jug-eared puppet of Prince Charles, who was famously shown talking on a telephone made of roses. Charles will return to puppet form in Newzoids, this time reimagined as a version of Gogglebox's Dominic Parker. The Duchess of Cornwall will be shown as a take on Steph, with the royal couple set to chortle and booze their way through a Gogglebox-style sketch.

            "Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League all season and on Saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to Chelsea’s imminent title victory. He is now the player you look to in a crisis. He is the man who has been eking out wins when the team hasn’t been at its best. He did it last week at Queens Park Rangers, winning the ball from the goalkeeper’s kick and driving into the box to set up Cesc Fabregas, and he did it on Saturday with his finish. He’s dragging them over the line at the minute. You wondered when Jose Mourinho came in whether Hazard would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him. And he would have taken the hint when he saw Juan Mata moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players. Eden Hazard fires past David De Gea following a storming run from the Belgian star into the box . Hazard celebrates in front of the Stamford Bridge faithful following his 38th minute strike . The Chelsea forward's first-half strike proved crucial as the Blues eked out a 1-0 victory . He perhaps looked at that and responded. You will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back — but not today, not against the best teams. Then he is required to do the requisite defensive work. And he does now. But the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing — and that was evident again on Saturday. He’s now on 17 goals for the season. He’s always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals. He is the danger man, he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team. He’s not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he’s creeping ever closer. What he will need to reach that level is for Chelsea to make a Champions League final and for him to be decisive. Hazard tries to guide a deflected shot into the United goal as Ander Herrera tries to snuff out the danger . He is improving every season, which is a good sign, and if he keeps doing that he has a chance of being that good. Chelsea will win the league now. I don’t think they’re at their best at the moment but managing a league campaign is not about playing well all the time. It’s about surviving the difficult periods — and Chelsea haven’t lost games when they’ve struggled in the same way that Manchester City or Manchester United did. Now they look a little tired as they get towards the finishing line and Mourinho would feel he has very strong squad of 13 and 14 but he will probably try to bring in people so he can give Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fabregas a couple of weeks rest at times to recuperate. As for United, for all their dominance in possession, they lacked enough clear-cut chances. In fact they needed something like the magic of Oscar’s back-heel and Hazard’s finish. Louis van Gaal will have been pleased that they controlled long periods of the game with their passing but they did lack that bit of punch. Wayne Rooney takes on Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Hazard at Stamford Bridge . With Wayne Rooney not being able to play at centre forward because of the injuries, it did neuter them somewhat. I thought he did well in midfield and proved that he can drop back into that position — his passing and play was excellent. But he’s been the thrust of the team in recent times. Maybe two years ago Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie could have provided that, but at the moment United need Rooney to give them that impetus in the really difficult games. When Sir Alex Ferguson left, you would have said it might take a couple of seasons to establish a new identity and build a new foundation. It’s been a bumpy ride and they wouldn’t have expected another change of manager, but at least, two years on, it looks as though they are now in that place. Jose Mourinho may look to give key players such as Fabregas (right) a rest in the coming weeks .\n",

            "Two years ago, Rafa Benitez was in charge of Chelsea and John Terry's glittering career at Stamford Bridge was in danger of fizzling out. In April 2013, the Spanish manager declared that Terry could no longer play two games a week and that controversial decision, twinned with a persistent knee injury, meant the former England international made just 14 appearances for his beloved in the 2012-13 campaign. Fast forward to 2015, the Blues captain has one hand on the Premier League trophy after arguably his most impressive season at the club - during which he has played a part in each of their 33 games so far. Chelsea captain John Terry is on course to appear in all 38 Premier League matches for his side this season . The Blues captain has made an appearance in all 33 Premier League games for Chelsea so far this season . It's an impressive tally for the 34-year-old, who will no doubt be hoping he can mark another memorable season with a personal best of having featured in all 38 Premier League games come the end of the season. If Terry manages to make appearances in all of Chelsea's remaining fixtures against Leicester, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, West Brom and Sunderland, he will beat the 37 domestic appearances he made during his side's last title-winning season in 2009-10. And he made 36 in 2004-05 and again the following season - his other two Premier League title triumphs. During his time as Blues boss, Rafa Benitez (left) believed Terry couldn't play two games in a week . Terry had to settle for a place on the bench under Benitez and made just 14 Premier League appearances . Speaking after the 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Sunday, manager Jose Mourinho said: 'I told John Terry in the dressing room that he made fantastic performances with me in six years but for me this was the best I have seen from him. 'It was the best JT has ever played. His defensive performance was absolutely amazing.' This season, Terry has played 2,970 minutes, scoring three goals along the way as Chelsea sit at the Premier League's summit, 10 points clear of second-placed Manchester City having already collected the Capital One Cup in March. The 34-year-old celebrates with the Capital One Cup after Chelsea's 2-0 victory against Tottenham in March . The Chelsea captain made 37 Premier League appearances during Chelsea's 2009-10 title winning season in . Terry's best seasons at Chelsea have largely been when Jose Mourinho has been in charge .\n",

            "One diner found her meal had extra crunch  this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on. Toni Elliot, 53, thought she had hurt a tooth when she sat for dinner at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee, on Thursday. However, when she spat out the mouthful she was chewing she discovered a pearl in the palm of her hand. Forty-nine precious stones followed. Instead of being horrified by the bizarre discovery, Elliot reportedly remained calm and even posed for photos with her treasure afterwards. Scroll down for video . Not what I ordered: Toni Elliot, 53, (right) found her meal had extra crunch this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee . As naturally-occurring pearls are rare, it's expected that Elliot's stash could fetch a princely sum. Eric Horton, who was serving Elliot at the time, said he couldn't believe what he saw happening. He swiftly grabbed a container to collect the pearls up from Eliot's dinner plate. Recalling the incident, he told WSMV News: 'It happens sometimes, every once in a while. 'However, this young lady continued to pull pearls out of her mouth, and the only thing we were missing was a string because she found 50 pearls in this one oyster.' Puckett's Boat House thought it could have broken a record for the most pearls in one oyster but apparently the number stands somewhere in the eighties . Eliot's fellow diners apparently laughed as they watched the unusual scene unfold. Puckett's Boat House thought it could have broken a record for the most pearls in one oyster but apparently the number stands somewhere in the eighties. The eatery said it was the first time such an incident had occurred in its history. Sometimes diners find one pearl in a mollusk but anything more is extremely rare.. Puckett's Boat House says it gets their oysters from the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana. Producing pearls is an oyster’s way of protecting itself against foreign substances, such as a parasite or piece of shell.\n",

            "Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .\n",

            "A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby was accused of being 'heartless' in court on Wednesday by angry family members. Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday . Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus . 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.' Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . He pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide for the deaths of the couple, who were from Wilder, Vermont, and to assault for the death of the fetus. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes on Thursday. During Wednesday's hearing, Dellinger's wife, Deborah, called him a man of 'ethics, integrity and friendship,' the Valley News reported. 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanks his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he wasn't suicidal at the time of the crash . Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. His lawyers want a sentence that would see him serve only about eight months in prison after being given credit for time already served. Investigators say Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013 . According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.' He . took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks . when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents . filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

            "Bowling Green basketball coach Chris Jans has been fired for acting inappropriately during a drunken night out at a local bar. The university, in Ohio, took action after damning footage emerged of the coach touching an unidentified woman's behind on March 21. The married father-of-two was also accused of grabbing a 'woman's head and moving it toward your crotch' and calling another woman a 'b****', the same evening. A source told reporters that the incident was so heated a woman slapped him before he was asked to leave. Scroll down for video . Bowling Green basketball coach Chris Jans has been fired after witnesses say he acted 'aggressively and inappropriately' at an off-campus bar . The university took action after footage emerged of the coach touching an unidentified woman's behind on March 21 . At least 50 people reportedly saw the coach out of control before being escorted out of the bar . The video, obtained by the Toldeo Blade, was recorded by the woman's parents. They then wrote a letter to Bowling Green athletics director Christopher Kingston detailing more of his inappropriate behavior. The correspondence, obtained by Deadspin, read: 'While we were enjoying each others company we noticed on several occasions Chris Jans making what seemed to be advances towards several women. 'On one occasion he grabbed a woman’s head and pushed it downwards toward his crotch. 'A Single guy, drunk, we can possibly overlook, but certainly inappropriate for a Head Coach representing my university and most definitely not a married man with two children. I am certain she would not appreciate his behavior. 'As the night continued, we had hoped that the behavior was a fluke or a joke amongst friends ad we continued enjoying each others company until he made advances toward another female, petter her backside and proceeded to as/tell her to walk in front of him so that he could evaluate her assets.' An assistant coach reportedly helped him out of the local bar in Bowling Green, Ohio. Jans recently led the team to its first postseason win in 40 years . Fox Sports Ohio's Zac Jackson reported that he'd been in the bar perhaps three hours and the woman who struck him did not speak with either police or university officials. However a cell phone video of the incident was recorded and upwards of 50 witnesses were in the bar. No charges have been filed. According to The Washington Post, a university press release announced the termination Thursday morning. 'Jans was terminated following an investigation into his recent public conduct,' the statement read. 'The University concluded that Jans' public conduct failed to meet his obligations as a head coach and the expectations that BGSU Athletics has for its coaches.' Jans leaves the school after a single season, taking the team to its first postseason victory in 40 years. His final record there stands at 21-12. He was formerly an assistant at Wichita State before he signed with Bowling Green. His six year contract was valued at $325,000.\n",

            "A puppy tends to be a beloved addition to any family, but for a family supporting a child with autism an Assistance Dog can make a crucial difference to their happiness and stability. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and Autism Assistance Dogs are a little known but hugely beneficial form of 'animal therapy'. It turns out man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism who may otherwise struggle to talk, communicate, walk or socialise. An 'Autism Assistance Dog' is used to keep a child with autism safe and are an incredible tool to help them develop social skills and positive relationships. The term 'Autism Spectrum Disorders' (ASD) is an umbrella term that includes Autistic disorder; Asperger's and Atypical Autism. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and people may be oblivious that man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism (stock picture) Children with autism often have difficulty with social interactions and their verbal and non-verbal communication skills may be badly affected. They can struggle to cope with change and unfamiliar environments and routines. 'The Autism Assistance Dog (AAD) Program is designed to improve the quality of life for both the child with autism and his or her family through three key areas: safety, independence and inclusion,' according to GuideDogs SA. Every child is unique meaning matching the right dog to their need's and their family is crucial. The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household. It has been reported by families participating in the Austism Assistance Dog Program that the companion can also foster positive interactions between siblings, encouraging play. The highly trained, specialised working dogs are licenced to accompany the child in essentially any location. 'An Austism Assistance Dog (AAD) has the same legal rights of access as a Guide or Hearing Dog. It is clearly identified by a coat which has securing points and a handle that the child can hold if appropriate or required,' according to GuideDogs SA. 'The purpose of the coat is to bring awareness to the special circumstances regarding the dog. This also increases the ease of access to public places by differentiating the status of an AAD from that of a pet.' The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household (stock picture) It can make family outings or even a quick trip to the shops possible where a child with autism may have struggled before. It can also give parents peace of mind as they know their child is being looked out for by a dog which has been specially trained to help their master avoid harm's way. The comfort of having their furry pooch by their side can offer a sense of stability for the child and be a calming presence on all members of the family. Children with autism 'have a high tendency to 'bolt' when they feel anxious or stressed. This is made even more alarming as they are often far less aware of danger and may not respond to direction. This can be a great challenge, requiring constant observance from their carer to ensure the child remains safe. 'On outings, the child's safety is enhanced by being connected to a coat on the dog's body, through a safety belt around the child's waist,' explained Guide Dogs SA. 'The parent has control of the dog through their own lead and will apply vocal commands to the dog. The child is encouraged to walk beside the dog but if they do choose to run off on their own, the dog is specially trained to quickly and calmly take control of the situation. 'The dog is trained to resist by sitting or lying down, acting as an \"anchor\",' GuideDogs SA explains. 'This gives the parent time to intervene and diffuse the situation.' However, the importance of this lesson is that, through the repetition, children's attempts to bolt are often reduced or completely eradicated. 'These dogs are a friend when you need one any hour of the day, every day of the year. 'They are also skilled for a few select tasks if you happen to need a hand… or a paw!'\n",

            "Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird and throwing another out of a window. The gang broke into an aviary and bundled 200 of the animals into sacks and containers around 3.30am on January 12. CCTV showed the men took the birds to a tower block in Walsall, West Midlands, and dumped them on the floor before kicking them and forcing them out of barely open windows. Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird, thought to be in the bag above, and throwing another out of a window in Walsall, West Midlands, on January 12 . The birds were also jammed into drawers, squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard. One resident reported that a dead bird was posted through his letterbox while others were dropped through windows. Three men and a youth have been convicted of their involvement and will be sentenced next month. Chad Worgan, from Walsall, admitted an offence of receiving stolen goods and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on the basis that he kicked a pigeon. The 19-year-old knew the animals were in the bags and had a 'sick grin across his face' as he appearing to grab one of the perched birds and visibly squeeze it, the court heard. Thomas Knox, from Bloxwich, denied the same charges. A dog belonging to Knox, also 19, was let into the flat to terrorise the birds, it was revealed. Jake Higgs, 23, from Bloxwich, admitted receiving stolen goods but denied causing unnecessary suffering. A 16-year-old from Erdington, Birmingham, also attended but cannot be named for legal reasons. The birds were also jammed into drawers, shoved through barely open windows (above), squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. One of the men (above) can be seen with a grin on his face during the attack . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. Bob Thomas, chairman of the bench, said their actions amounted to 'joint enterprise'. He added: 'They arrive with a dog and are seen to be carrying a variety of bags and containers. These are emptied by them and both a large number of dead and live birds are seen. 'The CCTV shows all of them entering the property together and all playing some part in the birds' suffering. 'We are satisfied that they were all aware of the contents of the bags.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'The birds were stolen from an aviary in the Brownhills area in the early hours of January 12. 'They were then taken to Dolphin House where they were emptied onto the landing area of the block.' The birds were stolen from rare bird breeder Lee Williams who had built up his collection of rare jays, finches, doves, budgerigars, quails and pigeons over a number of years. In 2008, the dad-of-two considered giving up his passion after 270 animals worth £4,000 were stolen. Speaking at the time, his wife Michelle said: 'This has devastated him. His bird breeding plays a major part of his life.'\n",

            "Israel's leader reacted furiously to the West’s nuclear deal with Iran yesterday, warning that it would threaten his country’s very survival. Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s agreement to reduce some of its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions would pave the way for Tehran to build an atomic bomb. In Iran yesterday, thousands danced in the streets to celebrate the landmark accord which could finally result in the easing of economic restrictions that have caused the price of essentials to soar and businesses to go bust. Danger: Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal will 'increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle-East' But Israel, which fears an Iranian nuclear attack, issued a series of dire warnings. Mr Netanyahu insisted that he and his Cabinet were united in ‘strongly opposing’ an agreement. ‘This deal would legitimise Iran’s nuclear programme, bolster Iran’s economy and increase Iran’s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond,’ the prime minister said. ‘It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.’ Other critics including Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US say the deal leaves scope for Iran to cheat. Barack Obama, however, has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, as a ‘historic understanding’. There are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on June 30, including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if Iran is found to have breached the terms. But Mr Netanyahu told President Obama in a phone call yesterday that the existing framework ‘would threaten the survival of Israel’. According to tweets from his spokesman Mark Regev, Mr Netanyahu said: ‘The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran. The deal would legitimise Iran’s illegal nuclear programme. ‘The alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on Iran until a better deal is achieved.’ Historic understanding: President Barack Obama hailed the nuclear agreement between Iran and U.S. while critics issued stark warnings . Mr Netanyahu is demanding that any final agreement must involve Iran’s recognition of Israel’s right to exist. President Hassan Rouhani has pledged that Iran will abide by its commitments in the nuclear agreement, which ends a standoff between Western powers and Iran lasting several years. Countries involved in the so-called P5+1 talks are the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. Under the proposed terms, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges, the equipment used to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel, by two thirds, and can only enrich it enough to use for domestic power generation, not weapons. The deal also means that for the first time the Iranians will agree to have their nuclear plants inspected. And a major nuclear plant at Fordow will have to become a research lab, although one at Natanz can still carry out enrichment. Mr Obama said yesterday: ‘This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. If Iran cheats, the world will know about it.’ He said that if the deal is finalised, ‘we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully’. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted his country was not surrendering and stood to gain from the deal. After arriving home, he issued a statement saying: ‘We have serious goals in the negotiations and eventually, based on what we have achieved so far, we believe we can reach them.’\n",

            "Mirko ‘Cro Crop’ Filipovic is desperate to scratch his eight-year itch when he takes on Gabriel Gonzaga in Poland on Saturday. Cro Crop lost to the Brazilian in 2007 when a first-round head kick brought a swift end to the bout at UFC 70. But he is confident he can avenge the defeat on home territory. Mirko Filipovic (right) faces Gabriel Gonzaga in Poland on Saturday, eight years after losing to the Brazilian . In 2007, Filipovic (right) was beaten by a first-round head kick and wants to avenge that defeat . Filipovic admitted revenge is a motivating factor ahead of the encounter against Gonzaga . ‘I want to beat all the opponents who have beaten me before,’ Cro Crop said. ‘But especially this fight because I lost to him and this time I feel better motivated and more prepared than I did last time. ‘He [Gonzaga] is a big guy. He is tough - he always goes for the victory and sometimes he is successful, sometimes he is less successful. But he definitely is a tough opponent for everyone. ‘I don’t want to think too far ahead - I am focusing on this fight and whatever is next, will happen. ‘I am in really great shape. My training is great - I keep the same schedule of training and I am prepared and ready for this fight. ‘I have been training with Stipe [Miocic] - he is a really great guy. We have been training really hard to prepare for both of our fights. He is just a great guy to train with and to be around. ‘All of the people I have lost against, I always want to fight again. UFC decided it would be Gonzaga and yes I wanted this rematch very much.’ Gonzaga, meanwhile, insists he does not view the fight as a rematch, given the eight-year wait. ‘I didn’t make any mistakes [in his last fight against Cro Cop] and he did make one, and I tried to capitalise on that,’ he said. ‘Eight years can change a lot. So much can change in that time so I do not consider this a rematch; I consider this a new fight. ‘I’ve got better in that time - my skill set has got better. ‘I’m going to try to avoid his high kick. But I will be ready wherever the fight goes. Gonzaga said he does not consider the fight with Filipovic a rematch because of the gap of eight years . Gonzaga believes that his skillset has got even better since the last time he took on Filipovic . ‘That’s the thing about the heavyweight division in the UFC, you know, one punch can change everything. ‘I believe people are never going to forget our first fight. But right now I just need to win this fight. ‘I always need to keep working towards the title shot. I am always trying to get there and I’m here to do that, to move closer to it.’\n",

            "Tiger Woods has had to face some huge challenges during his career, but not many will have been larger than 7ft 6in former NBA star Yao Ming. The 14-time major winner has played just three tournaments so far this year, which included a return to some form at the US Masters, but took a break to offer the retired Chinese basketball star a few golfing tips. The pair met up at Nike's headquarters in Shanghai where the former Houston Rockets centre towered over his tutor as he got to grips with his swing on an indoor range. Golf's former world No 1 is dwarfed by the 7ft 6in former Houston Rockets centre . Tiger Woods (left) gives Yao Ming a golfing lesson at the Nike headquarters in Shanghai, China . The towering Chinese athlete takes notes as Woods helps him get to grips with his swing . Meanwhile, Woods has confirmed he will return to the PGA Tour at the Players Championship on May 7. The 39-year-old announced on Twitter that he will tee it up at TPC Sawgrass for the tournament often labelled as the 'fifth major'. 'Looking forward to going back to THE PLAYERS this year, hoping for a repeat of 2013,' he said. Woods' confirmed return will dampen fears over a wrist injury he appeared to suffer during the final round at Augusta when he hit a tree root. 'A bone kind of popped out and the joint kind of went out of place, but I put it back in,' he said. Woods, pictured with Rory McIlroy, found some form on his return to the US Masters . Woods will be back at the TPC Sawgrass, allaying fears over a wrist injury picked up at Augusta . Speculation over Woods' return had been circulating ever since the Masters when, following rounds of 73, 69, 68 and 73, he refused to confirm when he would be back in action. 'Not going to be for a while,' he said. 'I have a little time off, and go back to the drawing board, work on it again, and refine what I'm doing. 'I really like what I'm doing, I got my distance back, and everything is good.' Jack Nicklaus said this week that Woods would feature at the Memorial at Muirfield Village beginning on June 4 but he will now be back earlier than that at a tournament that he won in 2001 and 2013.\n",

            "Bird numbers have dramatically declined in Fukushima, research has revealed. Scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident. They found that one breed in particular had plummeted from several hundred before the 2011 disaster to just a few dozen today. Researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima (shown after the disaster in 2011). The barn swallow, for example, dropped from hundreds to dozens. This is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall. And comparing it to Chernobyl could reveal what the future holds . The research, published in the Journal of Ornithology, was carried out by scientists at the University of South Carolina including biologist Dr Tim Mousseau. They showed that the situation has steadily worsened since the disaster on 11 March 2011. On that day, just over four years ago, Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake and its resultant tsunami. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. This led to three of the plant’s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials. Reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean-up effort difficult. A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami. Many populations were found to have diminished in number as a result of the accident, with several species suffering dramatic declines. One of the most hard-hit species is the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure. ‘We know that there were hundreds in a given area before the disaster, and just a couple of years later we're only able to find a few dozen left,’ said Dr Mousseau. ‘The declines have been really dramatic.’ And while background radiation has declined in the region in recent years, the negative effects of the accident on birds are actually increasing. ‘The relationship between radiation and numbers started off negative the first summer, but the strength of the relationship has actually increased each year,’ Dr Mousseau said. ‘So now we see this really striking drop-off in numbers of birds as well as numbers of species of birds. ‘So both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels, even as the levels are declining.’ Dr Tim Mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors, which use gamma-radiation-sensitive crystals (shown) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild . One hard-hit species was the barn swallow (stock image shown), Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure . The team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for Fukushima from the Chernobyl site, which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in Ukraine in 1986. One difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in Chernobyl, whereas it was year-round residents that were doing worse at Fukushima. This could be due to differences in DNA repair capabilities for migratory species as a result of flapping their wings - which lowers their antioxidant levels and makes them more vulnerable to radiation. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. Shown are radiation levels immediately after the accident in 2011 .\n",

            "From working late to boring marriages and just not being in love any more, there's no end to the excuses deployed by cheating spouses to get themselves off the hook. But one man has taken the art of the creative excuse to a new level and  claimed his sexually transmitted disease was the result of car exhaust rather than cheating, according to his ex. 33-year-old Stuart, had, said ex-girlfriend Sophie, offered up the novel excuse when accused of cheating after discovering that she had mysteriously contracted chlamydia. Scroll down for video . Car exhaust: Stuart, pictured with 'wife' Linda, claimed to have picked up chlamydia from a car exhaust . ‘I got a test for chlamydia because I’m sure he cheated on me,’ fumed Sophie during an appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show. ‘I’ve stopped him seeing the kids because he hasn’t paid for them, and he keeps threatening me.’ ‘He said he caught chlamydia from the car – from the exhaust pipe of the car.’ Unbeknown to Sophie, Stuart was sitting backstage with his new 'wife' Linda and burst onto the stage to deny he had ever used the bizarre excuse. 'I never said that!’ he insisted. Unfortunately, Stuart's appearance didn't quite go as planned with host Kyle unearthing a series of lies that belied his denial. Furious: The claim was made by ex-girlfriend Sophie who was outraged to find she also had the STD . Falling apart: Stuart's many falsehoods were swiftly unpicked by host Jeremy Kyle . Along with falsely claiming to be a paramedic, he also accused Sophie of attacking his new love Linda when in fact neither were true. Linda, although described by Stuart as his 'wife', turned out to be a girlfriend instead, having changed her name by deed poll rather than tying the knot. After going on an extended moan about his lack of access to his and Sophie's children, it also transpired that he had run off with his young son for five weeks. Adding to Stuart's pain was Sophie's mother Kathy who accused him of refusing to pay child support and instead proffering a £20 note every two weeks.\n",

            "It was 25 years ago this week that the skeletal remains of a woman were found near Daytona Beach in Florida - and police are still trying to find out who she is, and who killed her. The Jane Doe was found in a wooded area in Volusia County on April 23, 1990. Investigators believe her badly decomposed remains, which consisted mostly just bones, had been there for up to eight weeks before they were discovered. The death was ruled a homicide and the case remains open, and police hope a new facial reconstruction using the latest technology with help them finally solve the murder. Unsolved homicide: Forensics have used the latest technology to reconstruct the skeletal remains of a woman found near Daytona Beach 25 years ago this week to produce this image. She was never identified . A forensic artist recently created a lifelike, computer-generated image of the woman’s face, which is the biggest development in the case in years,The Daytona Beach News Journal reported. The Jane Doe is described as between 25 and 40 years old, about 5-feet 4-inches in height and of a medium build. At the time of her death, her brown hair was tied into pig tails. According to forensics, the woman seems to have had multiple children. The new reconstruction shows the vast improvements in forensic science over the years. The last image, released in 2001, was done by a FBI-trained facial reconstruction artist using the victim's skull. Advancements: The last image of Jane Doe was done in 2001 using the controversial method of forensic facial reconstruction, which relies on the victim's skull and an artist building the face using clay . Scene: The victim was found in a wooded area east of Clyde Morris Boulevard in Volusia County in April 1990 . Investigators are urging anyone with information to call Sgt. Pat Thoman at 386-254-1535.

            "Authorities in Virginia are searching for the cell phone of a missing young woman 40 miles from where she was last seen. Norfolk Police continued to look for Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, who has been missing since March 2, and focused on a pond near Carrsville after a new tip. Local resident Steve Hines said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to 13 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Wesley was been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time. AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake. Four items were found that belonged to her. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.\n",

            "A tiny garden gnome that appeared on the cover of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's album and was signed by all four band member has sold for £29,000. The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album. In total more than 60 celebrities appear on the famous cover including the Fab Four themselves - but because it would have been impossible to get all of them in a room together, waxworks and cardboard cutouts were used instead. The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album . The knee-high little gnome, circled, appeared next to George Harrison's left leg on the famous album cover . Other well-known figures include writer Edgar Allen Poe, dancer Fred Astaire, comedians Laurel and Hardy and boxer Sonny Liston, poet Dylan Thomas and philosopher Karl Marx. The album cover was the brainchild of artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth and photographer Michael Cooper, who constructed and shot it it on March 30, 1967. John Lennon had wanted models of Jesus and Adolf Hitler to be included but his requests were denied. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was £3,000 - a whopping £50,000 in today's money. Following the shoot Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by The Beatles, who each signed it. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. The cardboard gnome actually came in two parts and was pinned together for the cover. Gifted to a photography assistant it was signed by all for members of the band following the shoot . It emerged for sale almost 50 years after the album was released after it was listed for auction by a private collector. Experts at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, had given the gnome a pre-sale estimate of $25,000 - around £17,000 - but it ended up going to an unnamed buyer for $42,500 - or £29,000. Dean Harmeyer, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that it cost £3,000, equivalent to £50,000 in today's money . Peter Blake (pictured) and Jann Haworth designed the iconic cover using an ink drawing by Paul McCartney as inspiration . Paul McCartney had the initial idea for the iconic cover and outlined the cover in an ink drawing. The actual designing of the cover was done by artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth. The cover’s collage of famous faces includes 57 cardboard cut-out photographs (including two gnomes) and nine waxworks. They show a range of personalities from different walks of life including actors, sportsmen and scientists. The album also reflects the personal and artistic changes within the band at the time Sgt Pepper's was made. The influence of George Harrison’s exploration of Indian music and philosophy through the inclusion of self-realisation gurus. The fab four themselves appear in day-glow, mock military uniforms. Paul McCartney envisioned the Sgt Peppers band as alter egos the Beatles could use to distance themselves from their previous incarnations. John Lennon requested the inclusion of Hitler and Jesus in the artwork but he was turned down. Elvis did not appear on the album cover because it was felt he was too big an icon to be included. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles. 'Among the smaller items in the foreground was this garden gnome, which appears just to the right of George's leg. 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot. 'It is an incredible Beatles artefact.'\n",

            "(CNN)The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these: . The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. If it had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. It would reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime. Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies, Iran denies having such a program, and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. Iran's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point, and we'll know even more about Iran's program in the coming months and years because of the deal. In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians. What's more, the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran (i.e., the 47 senators' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president). This of course is not the case. The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia) plus Germany, dubbed the P5+1. While the United States has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. If the agreement reached by the P5+1 is rejected by Congress, it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas. Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause, after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases. Again, this is not the case. Some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years. But most importantly, the framework agreement includes Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. Thus, going forward, if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council. Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to \"advise and consent.\" But the issue is not suited for a treaty. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced.  The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal. Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah.  As important as these issues are, and they must indeed be addressed, they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal: preventing a nuclear Iran.  To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies, including Israel. Those judgments should be fact-based, not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions.\n",

            "FIFA presidential candidate Luis Figo on Wednesday disputed the Confederation of African Football's claim that all 54 votes from the continent will go to incumbent Sepp Blatter in the presidential elections next month. The former Portugal international, in Egypt at the CAF Congress to canvass for votes, told Sportsmail he did not believe all Africa was solidly behind Blatter, who seeks re-election on May 29 against Figo, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan and the Dutch football association president Michael van Praag. 'I feel there's a lot of respect for CAF among all the African federations but I'm positive that (CAF president) Mr (Issa) Hayatou did not speak in the name of the 54 members of the confederation,' said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder. Luis Figo does not believe that Sepp Blatter will receive ALL 54 votes from African nations . Blatter (left) has received the backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) 'Even when he (Hayatou) announced he would support Blatter, we could notice a difference from past congresses when a statement like that normally is followed by a standing ovation. 'This time we heard just a normal applause, which confirms my idea that a lot of African countries understand and agree with the need to change for the better of everyone, especially the national associations. 'In fact there were federation presidents who ensured me they would vote for me but they were reluctant to saying this out loud because they feared reactions against them, their federations and even their countries,' said Figo. 'It also to end this kind of atmosphere that I decided to be a candidate. Football should be about a beautiful game and people should be able to express themselves freely and openly.' Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency . Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe . The CAF congress in Cairo ended on Tuesday with Hayatou declaring Africa's complete support for Blatter's re-election but on all previous occasions when the CAF chief has promised a block of African votes, many have broken ranks. When Blatter came to power in 1998, Hayatou pledged Africa's votes to rival Lennart Johansson of Sweden but most defied him to vote Blatter into power. When Hayatou stood against Blatter in 2002, almost half the African countries voted for the Swiss rather than their own confederation president.\n",

            "Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday . Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday. The officer said he was appalled by the Labour peer’s note after his superiors forced him to drop his inquiries into Janner’s alleged sex abuse. The note thanked him for how he had dealt with the issue, and even invited him and his wife to dinner at Parliament. The revelation of Janner’s apparent attempt to influence the police came amid fresh concerns about the Establishment cover-up of the Labour grandee’s alleged paedophilia. Detectives have carried out four child sex inquiries into Janner since 1991, but attempts to bring him to justice were repeatedly blocked. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders announced earlier this month that he should been have charged on each occasion. But she went on to rule that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia. The decision has caused outrage – with critics pointing out that he signed letters in the House of Lords as recently as this month, and had held numerous dinners and events in Parliament since being diagnosed in 2009. It has also been revealed that Mrs Saunders was a pupil at the same legal chambers as Janner – although she claims she never met him. The furore over her decision grew yesterday as it emerged that: . The policeman who led the original investigation into Janner in the early 1990s spoke yesterday of how he was ‘gutted’ after orders to drop the case came ‘from the very top’. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, said his team uncovered evidence supporting allegations that the then-Leicester MP used his home and a hotel to abuse a teenage boy. He said he and fellow investigator Mick Creedon, now Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police, were prevented from arresting Janner. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia . ‘Someone higher up told us that we couldn’t just arrest an MP and it went no further. We were told that by someone senior, who I can’t name, but the order had to have come from the very top. I’m sure my bosses’ hands were tied,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I was extremely frustrated. Janner should have been arrested. He was treated differently because he was an MP.’ Mr Ashby, 65, added: ‘The bit that really got me was that I later got a Christmas card in the post from Greville Janner. ‘The card was an official House of Commons Christmas card and was handwritten. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, received a thank you note from Janner . ‘It said something like “I was very pleased with the way you treated me” and invited me and my wife for a dinner at the House of Commons. I couldn’t believe it. My wife was disgusted, as was I. Needless to say we never replied and never went.’ The decision not to charge Janner in 1991 was taken just weeks after Sir Allan Green quit as Director of Public Prosecutions when he was caught kerb crawling in King’s Cross in London. His deputy David Gandy took over temporarily until a full-time replacement was appointed the next year. But Mr Gandy, 83, yesterday said he could not remember seeing Janner’s case file. He told The Daily Mail: ‘I have no knowledge of it whatsoever. It may well be the decision was taken by someone else in the department or it could have been sent out for senior counsel to make a decision on. Whatever happened I simply don’t have any knowledge of it.’ Even Janner’s barrister, the late George Carman QC, who was instructed to defend him after the abuse allegations became public in 1991, was astonished that he escaped prosecution. His son Dominic Carman said: ‘My father was surprised that Janner was not charged. ‘He suspected there may have been some attempt to influence the decision by the DPP, although there was no proof.’ Investigative website Exaro said the four experts who examined the peer had not all agreed on the six key points about the nature and extent of his illness outlined in Mrs Saunders’s statement on why she was not going to charge him. Janner’s family have issued a statement insisting he is ‘entirely innocent of any wrongdoing’. Lawyers for Janner’s alleged victims could demand medical tests to check the extent of his dementia. Child abuse campaigners have questioned how the former Labour MP was able to sign a letter to the House of Lords on April 9, just a week before prosecutors said he would not face charges because of his deteriorating dementia. Now it has emerged that Janner could be examined by experts as part of compensation claims brought by his alleged victims. Richard Scorer, of law firm Slater and Gordon, told the Observer: ‘I have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia, and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that.’\n",

            "(CNN)A Connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as \"Cassandra C.,\" go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: \"We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal.\" Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then.  Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned, according to Michtom. \"She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad, and she's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment,\" he said. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Joette Katz, the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, told CNN in March the agency is \"very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life.\" The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. According to Michtom, the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home. So for now, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. \"The hospital is effectively jail,\" Michtom said.\n",

            "An Anzac soldier's cricketing skills were put to good use on the battlefields of Gallipoli when he picked up Turkish bombs and threw them back at the enemy during World War I. Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor, 30, received a Victoria Cross for his 48-hour effort that saw him lob live, palm-sized iron grenades from the trenches of Lone Pine to save the lives of his comrades. The Victoria Cross is the highest military honour an Australian can receive. LCpl Keysor even caught some of the bombs in mid-air, Channel 7's Sunday Night reported. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor served during World War I in Gallipoli and was awarded a Victoria Cross medal . The 30-year-old fought in the trenches at Lone Pine in Anzac Cove on the shores of Turkey . LCpl Keysor signed up just before the start of the war in 1914 as a pilot but instead was sent to the shores of Turkey. He had moved to Sydney after living in Canada for 10 years and had been a clerk for most of his life. In Australia, he discovered cricket and it soon became a passion for the young man. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said LCpl Keysor was an unlikely candidate to become a bomb thrower, but his strong arm soon solidified him as an asset to the Australian army. 'He's one of those blokes that's obviously got great hand-eye coordination. He should have been a test cricketer,' Mr Manera told Victoria Cross winner Ben Roberts-Smith who was hosting the Sunday Night special to mark the Anzac centenary. Every time LCpl Keysor picked up a grenade, he was risking his life to save others as Turkish bombs only had an eight-second fuse while soldiers were being killed around him. LCpl was awarded the VC for his 48-hour effort where he threw live grenades back at the enemy . His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, said her great uncle was a humble man who did not think he did anything special . 'He doesn't know how many seconds, how many fractions of a second he's got before he flings it back,' Mr Manera told the news program. 'It's a remarkable feat of endurance and every time he grabs one of those grenades he's putting his life on the line and he's doing it hundreds of times over a period of 48 hours.' Not only was he throwing bombs back at the Turkish army, LCpl Keysor was also shielding the blasts by throwing sandbags on top of them and covering them with his coat. His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, who penned a book about LCpl Keysor's life was told it was 'one of the most sustained acts of bravery' during World War I. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said each time LCpl Keysor picked up a Turkish bomb he was risking his life . The Sunday Night special was hosted by Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith who served in Afghanistan . A Sunday Night re-enactment shows Turkish bombs as palm-sized, iron grenades (left), which were then lobbed over trench walls back at the enemy by LCpl Keysor (right) 'It wasn't something that was done in the heat of the moment. It was something that was sustained for days,' she told Sunday Night. Ms Lockyer revealed her great uncle was a humble man and referred to his time at Gallipoli as the 'only adventure he ever had'. 'I'm proud of Leonard obviously and Leonard made the comment many times that \"I didn't do anything more special than others. I was noticed and that was the difference\",' she said. 'He thought he was no more deserving than any other of the soldiers at Lone Pine that day.'\n",

            "A Russian aerospace commander has sensationally claimed that some spy satellites are masquerading as space junk in Earth orbit. The official refused to comment on how many such satellites there were, and which countries were operating them. It suggests there could be more satellites than thought monitoring different countries on Earth. The claim was made by the commander of Russian Space Command. Oleg Maidanovich said someone was hiding satellites as space junk (artist's illustration of a satellite shown). But in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse . The claims were made by the commander of Russian Space Command, Oleg Maidanovich. He was speaking on a film called ‘Space Special Forces’ during a tour of Russia’s main centre for aerospace intelligence in Krasnoznamensk, near Moscow. ‘Very recently, specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites... made for radio-technical reconnaissance of equipment on Russian territory,’ he said. A reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite. They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes. Some are used to simply take images from the ground, while others relay information from one place to another. Many such satellites are used today for high-resolution photography of certain areas, for scientific or defense purposes. The film goes on to state that there ‘are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment.’ The comments were made yesterday on ‘Space Day’, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. Since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space – and Russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit. Their Space Command is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling Russia's defence satellites. It monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet, out of a total of 100,000 significant objects. Some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it’s not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are. MailOnline has asked the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) and Space Command for further information on the claim. The comments were made yesterday on ‘Space Day’, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin (pictured), on 12 April 1961.

            "(CNN)Aaron Hernandez is known for his swagger. Should he act any differently when he's on trial for murder? When the once rising star for the New England Patriots walks into court each day with what appears to be an air of confidence -- or is it bravado? -- he enters from a connecting holding room. Some court security officers who escort him are as tall and muscular as he is. Besides that certain bounce to his step, there's usually a smile. Jury deliberations resume Wednesday . Watch \"Downward Spiral: Inside the Case against Aaron Hernandez\" tonight at 9 p.m. ET. It hasn't been there as often in the last couple of weeks when state witnesses have included his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and his former boss, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who testified Hernandez would usually greet him with a kiss and a hug. Always impeccably dressed in suit and tie brought in by his defense team, Hernandez quickly scans the courtroom, usually starting with the rows of seats directly behind him. The front row is reserved for his family. Some days, none of his relatives is there. But when his mother, fiancée, brother and other friends attend, he winks, nods, smiles, jokes, laughs, flirts with his fiancée and mouths greetings to them including \"'thanks for coming' and 'I love you.'\" Twice, he nodded his head and smiled at me. It's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins, appearing at ease. They've been representing him since June 2013. There was an unfortunate moment. His mother once asked permission from a court officer to touch her son once the jury left the room. Given an OK, she reached over the bar to him, took one of his hands in hers and kissed it. Rules forbid contact. It did not go unnoticed by the family of victim Odin Lloyd. Hernandez does not avoid looking in their direction. He glances at Lloyd's relatives. Lloyd's mother Ursula Ward, who is in court daily, appears to look right back at Hernandez without expression from her usual seat on the end of a row. When one witness, a high school friend, testifies that Hernandez once allegedly talked about carrying a gun, Hernandez appears to glare at him. When his fiancée takes the stand and testifies Hernandez told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after Lloyd's slaying, his eyes are glued on her. She barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out. When Kraft is asked to officially point out Hernandez in court and describe what he was wearing, I watch Hernandez look down at his shirt and tie as Kraft detailed his outfit. When the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $40 million bonus in 2012 -- Hernandez turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom. Would it be the last time he'd see him in person? On the last day of testimony when his defense rests its case, he smiles at relatives. But as he walks out the door this time, he doesn't look back.\n",

            "Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini insists that reports Xherdan Shaqiri is set to leave the club this summer are 'completely made up'. The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of £12million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract. The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches. Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window . And it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season, but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy. 'This Shaqiri thing is completely made up,' he told reporters. 'We bought Shaqiri last January because we think that he can have a big future at Inter. Then during the season, there might be a moment when a player's form drops, and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in. So that's the only situation going on right now. 'Shaqiri has our full confidence. He is our player. Then he has also changed his team, so it's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage. Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches . 'It's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself. 'He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason. So one only plays when he deserves to play. 'We bought Shaqiri because we believe in his qualities,' Mancini added. The Inter boss insists Shaqiri will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary . 'Then if Bayern [Munich] decided to sell him, it's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play. 'Inter could be the right solution for him and we are happy about this. I am sure that Shaqiri next season will achieve great things.'\n",

            "He was once the most powerful man in the world, but former US President Bill Clinton says he believes he should take a more backstage role should his wife, Hillary, decide to run for President. In an interview with Town & Country Magazine, the 68-year-old revealed that he believes he has lost his natural flair for political campaigning, adding that becoming a grandparent to his daughter Chelsea's six-month-old daughter Charlotte has tamed the angry side of his personality which once helped to propel him to victory. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' he said. Scroll down for video . Back seat? President Clinton plans to stay out of the limelight if and when Hillary Clinton launches her expected run for president, he tells Town and Country Magazine in a new interview . Doting grandparents: The Clintons had long spoken of their desire to have a grandchild - a dream which came true last year when their daughter Chelsea gave birth to baby Charlotte (pictured) Undecided role: 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad,' he said . 'I think it's important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she's never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters and that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.' The interview provides a rare inside look at the couple's mindset ahead of a widely expected impending presidential announcement. According to reports, Mrs Clinton is currently in the process of preparing to launch her bid within the next two weeks, and she's rumored to have already signed a lease for her campaign office in Brooklyn. However, she has to officially declare as a candidate within the next two weeks if she is going to run. If Mrs Clinton is elected, the former President added that his wife 'would have to assess what she wants me to do'. In addition to his new, calmer outlook on life, former President Clinton may have other reasons for wanting to avoid playing an active part in his wife's campaign. Ready for more? Mrs Clinton is widely expected to launch a bid within the next two weeks . Looking back: The former President's role in Hillary's 2008 campaign was reportedly a source of great tension in the Clinton camp . According to reports at the time, his role in his wife's 2008 campaign was a source of great tension in the Clinton camp. Many of his political advisers joined her campaign, and some of them didn't get on with Mrs Clinton's staff. And this time around, Mrs Clinton is thought to be off on a good foot, holding a substantial lead over her fellow Democrats, as well as a top spot in general election polling. Mr Clinton added that the couple has not discussed what her campaign – or her potential election – would mean for their philanthropic foundation. 'We might have to change the [foundation] rules again. But we haven't talked about that yet, and I don't think we should,' he said. 'You can't. It's hard for any party to hang onto the White House for 12 years, and it's a long road. A thousand things could happen.' Whatever occurs, Mr Clinton's priority is to keep the foundation alive whether he's running it or not. Outspoken: The former President previously sparked controversy on his wife's campaign trail, including with remarks about President Obama's 2008 campaign being a 'fairytale' ahead of the South Carolina primary . Groundbreaking: Mrs Clinton has the chance to become the first female president in American history, which would make former President Clinton as the 'First Man' The Bill effect: Mrs Clinton is ahead in the polls and it is thought that the Democrats would like to see her run for the White House. The family is pictured at former President Clinton's second inauguration . The Clinton Foundation is running 3,100 projects around the world, affecting the lives of 430 million people. The former President has spoken about life as a grandfather and how watching baby Charlotte grow has been 'a hoot'. 'It's amazing,' Mr Clinton said on the Ellen Show towards the end of last year. 'Hillary and I only have one child and she's quite wonderful, but it's been a long time since she's been that age.' Meanwhile, daughter Chelsea has said her parents are totally involved in their granddaughter's life, all the way down to changing diapers. She told Jimmy Kimmel that they are  embracing their new roles as grandma and grandpa Clinton. 'They're changing diapers, reading to her, helping her go to sleep at night,' she said. 'It's just been such a joy for me to watch them sort of rediscover that part of their lives and to watch them as grandparents.'\n",

            "Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener . Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf . 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City . He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'\n",

            "A large gas pipeline exploded into a tower of fire on Friday in Central California, closing both directions of a major highway and injuring at least 15 people, four of them critically, authorities said. It was not clear what caused the explosion at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range that brought traffic in the area to a halt. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road alongside Highway 99, according to Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. Scroll down for video . A fireball erupts after a large gas pipeline exploded in Fresno, California, on Friday. The explosion and fire closed both directions of Highway 99, authorities said . A firefighter watches the blaze shot well over 100 feet into the air. Eleven people were injured, three critically, in the explosion . The flames shot well over 100 feet into the air, witnesses said. Traffic heading north and south on Highway 99 in Fresno was halted by the explosion about 2.30pm as flames towered over the roadway, the California Highway Patrol reported. The highway was reopened three hours later, the CHP said. The driver of the front-loader was a county public works employee who had been working at the shooting range all day working on a tall berm that confines gunfire to the range, Mims said. Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast. Four patients were being treated at Community Regional Medical Center's burn and trauma unit, spokeswoman Mary Lisa Russell said. Three of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened at the gun range while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road, according to authorities . Pacific Gas & Electric crews are seen in the distance along the Fresno road after the massive explosion . Four other patients were taken to St. Agnes Hospital and three more to Madera Community Hospital. Asked whether the driver was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded, Mims said her office is investigating. 'Hopefully we'll be able to speak to the worker to see what action he was taking at the time,' she said. Mims noted PG&E had, some time ago, marked the location of gas lines in the construction zones. The flames prompted a two-alarm call of firefighters, said Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department. A nearby rail line was also halted out of concern that a passing train could spark leaking gas. Kevin Ling was driving by shortly after the blast, and he saw fire flying into the sky. 'As I got closer, the flames were just bigger and bigger,' he said. 'It was shooting up to 200 feet or more, and a fireball maybe ten-to-15 feet in diameter. It was like out of a movie.' 'My window was up and my AC was on and it still felt like a furnace inside my car,' he added. Emergency respondents gather near the scene of a gas line rupture. Those who were injured were taken to several different hospitals in the area . Highway 99, a major highway in central California, was closed in both directions after the gas-line explosion . The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Martinez said. A front-loader was in the area, but it's unclear if the vehicle was digging at the time of the explosion, he said, adding that 'it was a large explosion that shook the surrounding area'. PG&E spokesman Denny Boyles said the pipeline was damaged by a vehicle and that the line was buried but he didn't know how deeply. The flame from the pipe was extinguished at about an hour and a half after the blast, he said. Another PG&E spokesman, Keith Stephens, referred questions to local authorities. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are reported to be injured,' he said. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office is investigation as to whether the driver of a front-loader doing work in the area was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded . The California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement that it is investigating the explosion in cooperation with the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. PG&E's natural-gas operations have been under scrutiny following a fiery 2010 PG&E pipeline blast that killed eight people in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno. National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed faulty safety practices by PG&E, and lax oversight by state regulators, for the 2010 blast. Earlier this month, state regulators leveled the state's biggest-ever penalty against a utility - $1.6billion - against PG&E for the San Bruno blast. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker said at the time that continuing safety citations against the utility made him doubt that the utility had embraced a culture of safety, and he raised the possibility of breaking apart the utility's gas and electric operations. The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department, said . Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast .\n",

            "A 65-year-old schoolteacher is set to become the oldest woman ever to give birth to quadruplets. German Annegret Raunigk, already has 13 children, and her remarkable story will be featured in a TV documentary. Her latest pregnancy was the result of artificial insemination using both donated sperm and eggs. Scroll down for video . Annegret Raunigk, a primary school teacher from Berlin, will create medical history when she becomes the oldest mother of four in a single birth in the world . Ms Raunigk, who is in the 21st week of her pregnancy, said she was ‘shocked’ when an ultrasound scan showed she was carrying quadruplets. Her gynaecologist initially mentioned the possibility of a 'selective reduction', where one or more fetuses is aborted in a multi-fetal pregnancy, but she declined. But the English and Russian teacher, who is due to retire this year, said she decided to have the babies as she was ‘still quite fit’ and capable of looking after them. She added: ‘I don’t think I will have any problems.’ Ms Raunigk, from Berlin, previously made headlines in Germany when she had her daughter Leila at the age of 55. Baby fame: Ms Raunigk, then 55, hit the headlines in Germany ten years ago, when she gave birth to her youngest child, Leila (pictured in 2005) She told German media that she does not worry about what her future will look like in five years time, with a teenage daughter and the young quadruplets, as she assumes she will 'stay healthy' Her 13 children – the oldest of whom is 44 – are by five different fathers, and Ms Raunigk has seven grandchildren. She defended her decisions to get pregnant later in life, saying: ‘I think one needs to decide for oneself and not listen too much to the opinions of others.’ At present, the oldest woman to have given birth to quads is Merryl Fudel, who was 55 at the time. The oldest woman ever to give birth is Indian Omkari Panwar, who was believed to be 70.\n",

            "Google launched a new U.S. wireless service today that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks . Google is already the world’s most popular phone software provider, and a pay-TV operator - and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier. The company has unveiled a U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low. The service, called 'Project Fi,' debuted today, about two months after Google revealed its plans to expand its ever-growing empire into providing wireless connections for smartphones. Google is selling the basic phone service for $20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month, instead of a flat rate. Each gigabyte of data will cost $10 a month. That means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month. Most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without refunding any money. Project Wi-Fi initially will only be sold to a narrow US audience that owns the Nexus 6, a smartphone that Motorola Mobility made with Google's help. Google's pricing setup makes Project Fi less expensive than most of the comparable plans offering by the four biggest wireless phone carriers - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. The monthly prices for a single line of smartphone service with up to one gigabyte of cellular data at those carriers range from $45 to $50 compared to $30 from Google. The major carriers, though, offer a variety of family plans that could still be better deals than Project Fi. Those bundled plans allow several phone lines to share a pool of cellular data. Scroll down for video . Besides trying to bring down the prices of wireless phone plans, Google is promising subscribers that their Nexus 6 model will automatically connect with the fastest network available. Rather than building its own network, Google is leasing space on cellular towers built by Sprint and T-Mobile, which are hoping the deals will boost their profits without costing them too many customers tempted to defect to Project Fi. To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. In this map, the dark green areas are covered by the service's 4G LT, the lime green is covered by 3G and the pale green by 2G . Verizon 4G LTE coverage is pictured for comparison. Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks . The service will work only on the company's Nexus 6 phones and only in the US . Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks. Overall, it costs $20 for basic service, which includes unlimited domestic talk, unlimited texting, tethering, and access in 120 countries. Customers pay $10 per GB of data. Data is paid for in advance, and the cost of unused data gets refunded rather than rolled over or lost. Phone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet. Calls can be made via Hangouts on Android, iOS, and through Gmail on desktops, via the Hangouts widget. Texts can be made and received in the same way. There is no annual service contract required when you sign up . To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. Google is promising Project Fi will automatically switch over to an available Wi-Fi network if that is running at a higher speed than the cellular alternatives. T-Mobile CEO John Legere, whose company already has been cutting its prices and rolling out new options, said it was a 'no-brainer' to work with Google on Project Fi. 'Anything that shakes up the industry status quo is a good thing — for both US wireless customers and T-Mobile,' Legere wrote in a blog post. Google has an incentive to promote cheaper and faster wireless service as a mobile virutal network operator. This is because it operates some of the world's most popular online services, including its search engine, maps, Gmail and YouTube video site. The Mountain View, California, company believes most people will visit those services more frequently if they are enticed to stay online for longer periods, giving Google more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. Similar motives prompted Google to begin building high-speed, hard-wired networks capable of navigating the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than existing broadband services. Although Google is only selling its broadband service in a handful of U.S. cities so far, AT&T and Comcast are now offering options with comparable speeds in a few communities. Price in Dollars: This graphic shows how much Google's new Project Fi will cost for various plans. For Talk and Text only, the Google carrier will cost $20 a month as compared to $35 for new partner TMobile. However the savings really start when 5GB of LTE is consider - with the Internet search giant's plan coming in at $70 and telecom giant Verizon's costing $110 a month . Project Fi initially will only be sold to a narrow US audience that owns the Nexus 6, a smartphone that Motorola Mobility made with Google's help .\n",

            "Tiger Woods declared himself ready to compete for a fifth Masters title after completing 11 holes of practice at Augusta National on Monday. Woods has started just two events in 2015, shooting a career-worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on February 5. That led to the 14-time major winner taking a break from competition to work on his game, during which time he dropped outside the world's top 100 for the first time since September 1996, a slide which continued on Monday as he fell from 104th to 111th. Tiger Woods returned to action as he warmed up at Augusta National Golf Club ahead of The Masters . The 39-year-old is returning from a self-imposed break from golf to recover from injuries and a dip in form . Woods was given a warm welcome by the crowd and stopped to sign several autographs at Augusta . Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the 39-year-old only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta. However, after showing no sign of the chipping 'yips' which blighted his performance in Phoenix on the range, Woods produced some vintage shots as he completed the front nine alongside long-time friend Mark O'Meara before playing the 10th and 18th alone. 'I felt good. It was nice to get out here,' said Woods, who was two under after four holes despite a wayward drive on the first and three-putting the par-five second for a par. 'Chipping is fine. I wanted to test out some wedges out here. That was why I was chipping a little bit more. It came down to a couple of different bounce settings because it's different from Florida. We figured the right one out. 'It's been a process. But I'm on the good side now. It's progression. I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament and it's finally there.' Woods has not won a major since the US Open in 2008 and will be looking to get back to his best . Woods stopped to chat to Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta on Monday . O'Meara, who won the Masters and Open in 1998, said: 'The thing about the kid is that you can never underestimate Tiger Woods. I'm a huge fan, a friend and I care about him. 'It was good to be out there with him. I saw some good signs. His pitching looks a lot better. 'There's a lot of pressure on him but there is no reason why he should not have a good week this week. 'There are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has. The game of golf is better because of Tiger Woods. 'He is in a good place and I think he is fired up about it. He will be nervous on Thursday but I think he will be fine. He hit a couple of shots that were a little off but a lot of quality shots.' Earlier in the day, US Open champion Martin Kaymer said he still felt Woods was 'the man,' but added: 'Who really knows what is going on in his head? Woods looked confident and managed to pull off some impressive drives in front of the crowd . Woods hits a chip shot on to the green during the practice session ahead of the Masters 2015 . Woods smiles during the practice round prior to the tee off of the 2015 Masters on Thursday . 'I hope he's happy. I hope he's fine. I hope he will play well this week. But what would bother me a lot is all the speculation. You don't have a choice; you will read about it somewhere. You will hear about it because you socialise with people. 'So mentally it must be quite exhausting and we know how important the mental part is in golf. It's difficult and some things I don't find very fair. You know, you should just let him be. Let him play golf, what he likes to do. 'Sometimes I look at it and find it quite sad how people treat the whole subject. It shouldn't be like this in my opinion. But that's how it is unfortunately.

            "The European Union launched a . legal attack on Gazprom on Wednesday, stoking tensions . with Moscow as it accused the Russian gas giant of overcharging . buyers in Eastern Europe and hindering competition. European Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said . Gazprom was barring EU clients from selling on its gas to other . states - a particular concern in recent efforts to aid Ukraine - and pressuring governments to back its pipeline interests. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the charges were 'absolutely unacceptable'. The European Union launched a legal attack on Gazprom on Wednesday, stoking tensions with Moscow as it accused the Russian gas giant of overcharging buyers in Eastern Europe and hindering competition . European Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager (pictured) said Gazprom was barring EU clients from selling on its gas to otherstates . State-controlled Gazprom is a vital supplier of energy to . Europe despite the EU's frequent political disputes with Moscow. The Commission's investigation, opened in September 2012, . had initially covered Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, . Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Relations with Russia, and Gazprom in particular, have since . been poisoned more by the East-West confrontation over Ukraine. 'Gazprom is dominant in all these markets,' EU Competition . Commissioner Vestager told a news conference. 'Our preliminary . view alleges that Gazprom is abusing this position.' 'Gazprom has been able to charge higher prices in some . countries without fearing that ... gas would flow in from where . prices were lower,' she said of contracts with the three . ex-Soviet Baltic states and formerly communist Poland and . Bulgaria. Vestager said prices in some countries were as much as 40 . per cent higher than in others. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite welcomed the . charges, saying: 'The era of Kremlin-backed political and . economic blackmail draws to a close.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the charges were 'absolutely unacceptable' Noting the investigation had begun before Russia annexed . Crimea from Ukraine, Vestager said 'this case is not political' but acknowledged some would see political elements in it. Gazprom responded by calling the charges, to which it has 12 . weeks to respond, 'unfounded' and saying it expected a . resolution within the framework of previous undertakings between . the Kremlin and Brussels 'on the intergovernmental level'. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the EU charges against Gazprom were an unacceptable attempt to retroactively apply the bloc's latest energy rules to earlier contracts. Asked to comment on the case, Lavrov said in an interview with three radio stations: 'All contracts in effect now that Gazprom signed with its partners, were signed with full respect of the legal regime that existed in the EU at the time. 'After the EU adopted the so-called third energy package... there have been attempts, and they continue now, to retrospectively, retroactively apply those requirements to old contracts as well. That is absolutely unacceptable.' The EU has brokered deals to keep gas flowing to Ukraine . despite the conflict between Kiev and Moscow, but efforts to . supply gas via eastern EU states have been hindered by contracts . with Gazprom that prohibit the re-export of Russian gas. Gazprom had also pressured Poland and Bulgaria into . accepting unfavourable terms over gas pipeline control and . construction, the commissioner said. The decision to move against Gazprom comes a week after . Vestager charged U.S. tech giant Google with abusing . its market power, following five years of hesitation by her . predecessor. She said, however, that in other cases she would be . willing to negotiate with firms without pressing charges. The Dane has appeared determined to challenge big corporate . powers since taking on the powerful post in November, regardless . of past offers of compromise from both Google and Gazprom. Despite insisting she would look only at the legal merits of . a case that focuses on Gazprom's pricing policies for different . customers, the accusations will not ease frictions with Moscow . over Ukraine in which gas supplies have played a major role. Gazprom offered concessions to Vestager's predecessor last . year in a bid to settle the case and avoid a possible fine but . talks failed over its refusal to cut prices in eastern Europe. The Russian behemoth, with annual sales of some $100 . billion, supplies about 30 per cent of the 28-nation EU's natural . gas. It has been under investigation since September 2012, . including for hampering the flow of gas across Europe. Vestager can order companies to change their business . practices and is theoretically able to levy fines of up to 10 . per cent of their annual global turnover.\n",

            "A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law – Section 6103 of Title 26 – that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded – and received – a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget – but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads. 'The names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates – the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the IRS – are directly related to the issue of class certification.' Dlott decided that without the list, the plaintiffs wouldn't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of America's tax collectors. Courthouse News Service first reported her ruling. The IRS is the federal agency Americans most love to hate, polling worse in opinion surveys than Congress . A partial list was unearthed by USA Today in September 2013, showing that as of 2011 the IRS had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions. In an IRS spreadsheet published online by the newspaper, partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as 'propaganda.' Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions.\n",

            "(CNN)An American teenager who helped her boyfriend stuff her mother's lifeless body into a suitcase at an upmarket hotel in Bali has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Heather Mack, 19, who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago, was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August. Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort. Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple's relationship. The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort.  They told the driver they'd be back soon, but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag, noticed blood and called police. The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. Inside the bag, von Wiese-Mack's body had been wrapped in hotel bedding. A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate. Described as a Chicago socialite, von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter. Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated. He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend's mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room. \"She squeezed my neck for about 20 to 30 seconds. I couldn't breathe. I had blood going to my head and my eyes were so watery,\" Schaefer told the court. He said he reached for a nearby bowl \"before she could.\"  \"I couldn't see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and I was distraught, I was in a state of mind, I had no idea what was happening. I was almost about to black out. And I grabbed it and I started swinging,\" he told the court. Mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple's unborn baby, according to local media. The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder, because Mack's mother disapproved of their relationship. After being detained by police, the couple initially claimed they'd been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Heather's mother, and from whom they managed to escape. The two were tried separately, though both trials were heard by the same court, with the same prosecutors. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack. Under Indonesian law, Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years, after which she can nominate who should take custody. Journalists Fairuz Husaini and Ragil Lestari and CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.\n",

The veteran Scot recovered from losing the opening frame to move 4-2 ahead, but both players were struggling for rhythm in Beijing.

John Higgins moved into the quarter finals of the China Open with a 5-4 victory over Judd Trump . Trump had a 59 point lead in the deciding frame before being dumped out by the veteran Scotsman . His reward will be a clash with world No 4 Ding, who dispatched two-time world champion Mark Williams 5-2. The Chinese took the initiative in the opening frame with a 68 and from then on never looked back, winning the last two frames with Williams failing to pot a single ball. World champion Mark Selby was also a 5-2 winner over David Gilbert in a low-quality clash and the world No 1 will next face Robert Milkins, who thrashed Michael White 5-1, which included four breaks over 50.

            "Tehran, Iran (CNN)There is a Persian proverb that says: \"A good year is determined by its spring.\" For many Iranians, the historic decision by Tehran and six world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- to continue nuclear negotiations under a \"joint comprehensive plan of action\" is an indication that this year's Norouz, the Persian New Year that started on March 21, will be a superb one indeed. Although edgy hardliners may now try to play games and complain the preliminary agreement is not what they had hoped, for many people it shows excellent progress and that's what they want. It paves the way for a much broader deal by end of June that guarantees the peaceful nature of Tehran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and a return to the international community. As is, the stakes are high and the choice is clear for President Hassan Rouhani and his \"moderate\" administration. They must now be over the moon: In early 2016, there will be Legislative and Assembly of Experts elections, the latter of which elects the country's leader. This historic agreement will make sure they win both the elections. So far, Rouhani's team has done nothing to improve the living conditions of ordinary Iranians who complain they have lost half of their purchasing power in recent years. READ MORE: Will Iran's Supreme Leader drink 'poison' of peace? During his presidential campaign, he promised to do so \"only\" if he could seal a nuclear deal with the world powers. And now he has. A full deal ultimately represents a referendum on the Rouhani administration's foreign policy. It will definitely strengthen his hand, which he needs to stay in the game, or better yet, win the next presidential race. The good news is that people are more than happy to welcome the preliminary agreement. They had always wanted a way out of the current impasse with the rest of the world and as a reward they could keep the moderates in power for the foreseeable future. Iranians blame sanctions and the previous hardline government for the sorry state of affairs in the economy -- especially the way they so poorly handled past nuclear talks of the past -- with devastating consequences. Many believe that now there is a joint comprehensive plan of action -- the culmination of a 12-year process -- there is something to hope for. In many respects, it's a new beginning and that allows Iranians a very small degree of hope inside themselves too. Looking back, the previous government traded those expectations for international isolation and economic hardship. Despite skepticism, even the country's leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, now feels that the light at the end of the tunnel might not be a train and that the talks could end well. READ MORE: What's in the Iran nuclear deal? 7 key points . Little wonder he had urged the nation -- including the well-funded hardliners -- to support the government's overture, saying the negotiating team was trustworthy and had been doing a fine job. It was a historic gesture that represents qualified support for continued diplomacy and that could lead to a historic step forward. It places confidence and hope in the negotiating team and the P5+1 group of world powers, guaranteeing no-one in Iran will stand in the way of principled diplomatic engagement and international rapprochement. Within this context, many Iranians are jubilant. They should be. More than ever, they are confident that not striking a comprehensive deal would be a historic mistake. They are confident it is within reach and this is as it should be: A win-win deal for all. They now strongly believe the lifting of international sanctions is no longer illusive. It would resuscitate the country's ailing economy and improve their lives. At least, that's what they hope. It's early spring and people on the streets are talking about nothing but the current choice. It represents the biggest chance of rapprochement between Tehran and Washington since the Iranian revolution in 1979. After all, for many Iranians this is more than just a nuclear agreement.\n",

If Rafael Benitez wants to return to English football after leaving Napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic Olympic Stadium in a year's time. West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost. Sam Allardyce is not the man to lead West Ham into their new exciting adventure at the Olympic Stadium . Allardyce (left, pictured behind Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini) has not been up to scratch . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's brilliant column on Jack Grealish . The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom. If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game — 31 points from 17 matches — they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season — 12 points from 16 games — they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival. Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project .\n",

            "The city of Naypyidaw is shrouded in secrecy. It first became the capital of Myanmar a decade ago, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon (also known as Rangoon) with minimal explanation. Since then, although developed to be the size of 120 Manhattans and to have space for up to one million residents, it remains a relative ghost town. Scroll down for video . Myanmar's newly-built capital city, Naypyidaw, is shrouded in secrecy, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon . Built mainly for government staff, locals only come to live in the city, which looks more like no man's land than a booming metropolis, if they need to for work. The super-sized highways have up to 20 lanes and are built to be big enough for government SUVs, though some report that the massive roads were also constructed as runways to accommodate the landings of military. Official records state the population is just over 924,000, though any photographs taken would beg to differ. The streets are barren, with just a handful of individuals spotted walking or cycling through the secluded capital at any given point during the day. The city was developed mostly for government staff, including residential zones to house employees in four-storey apartment blocks . Despite a reported population of 924,000, the city's streets are barren and it's rare to see more than a couple of people at any given time . The building of Naypyidaw began in 2002, with it location chosen in the middle of a jungle that hadn't been lived in for more than 2,000 years. Although some government workers moved to the new capital at the beginning of 2005, many employees were separated from their families due to a lack of schools and other amenities. Split into various zones, the city keeps the government ministries far from the military area and there is also a designated commercial zone and hotel zone, despite a lack of tourism in the region. Burmese workers walk past the massive Parliament building surrounded by high gates and empty 10 lane roads . A street sweeper cleans this empty super-sized highway in the seemingly secluded capital city by hand with a broom . The residential areas are carefully organised into 1,200 four-storey apartment blocks. The roofs of the buildings are colour-coded by the jobs of their inhabitants. Despite the government-issued housing, many of the residents still live in slums. When it comes to recreational activities, there's the beautiful Uppatansanti Pagoda, which is similar in size and shape to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, as well as several parks and gardens, including a water fountain complex that hosts a musical light show each night. Foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit the secluded city and foreign aid workers prefer to commute daily from Yangon . But there are not many people around to enjoy the sights. Reportedly, foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit, especially amid travel agent reports that the area may be 'dangerous,' and foreign aid workers who have visited the city in an official capacity are apparently so spooked by the eerie emptiness that they prefer to commute in daily from Yangon. Despite the fact that the government set aside almost 5 acres of land each for foreign embassies and headquarters of UN missions, only the Bangladeshi embassy has moved to Naypyidaw so far.\n",

            "Just a day after being released from jail, the man who was beaten by cops following a two-and-a-half hour chase on horseback has spoken out to detail his painful arrest. Helicopter cameras caught a swarm of cops kicking and punching 30-year-old Francis Pusok more than 80 times on Thursday, after he fled his southern California home when they tried to arrest him for identity theft charges. In an interview with NBC 4 on Monday,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear 'This isn't over'. Scroll down for video . Scarring experience: Francis Pusok (left) spoke for the first time on Monday, four days after he was beaten up by cops in footage taken from a helicopter. His girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, pictured center . When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house on Thursday, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. On the run: Pusok fled his house in San Bernardino County on Thursday after Sheriff's deputies showed up to arrest him on identity theft charges. He led police on a more than two-hour long chase, part of it on horseback . On the ground: At the end of the chase, police officers shot Pusok with a taser and he fell to the ground. Pusok claims they handcuffed him within 15 seconds and then continued to beat him despite the fact he was lying helpless on the ground . Cruel: The helicopter continued to record the first two cops beating Pusok up as more deputies swooped in . Under investigation: In the aftermath of the disturbing video, 10 officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated . Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, \"When is it going to stop?\"' Bruised: Pusok sports a painful black eye in his booking photo. He was released from jail on Sunday . After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. Deputies have been called to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. Disturbing: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon says he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that he has launched an internal investigation . However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.' She also said that Pusok, father of their three children, was arrested in 2002 for driving at unsafe speed on a sidewalk but that he was only riding a bicycle at the time. What concerns Bindner the most though was the one deputy's alleged whispered threat of 'This isn't over' at the end of the beating. 'That concerns me because we have children together and I don't want any kind of retaliation against me or my children,' she said. Doing better: After visiting her longtime partner in jail on Sunday, Pusok's girlfriend Jolene Bindner said he was on the road to recovery . Threats: The couple share three children together and have another on the way. Bindner (left) says she is concerned about a deputy who whispered 'This is not over' to her boyfriend at the end of the beating . Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell said his client's criminal history has nothing to do with any possible excessive force case. 'If it wasn't for that helicopter and the camera...they would be charging him with 10 counts of battering a police officer,' Terrell said. 'That's how it rolls here, that's what goes on every single day.' Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.\n",

            "Cristiano Ronaldo brought up another landmark in his glittering career with his 300th goal for Real Madrid in his 288th game during the 2-0 La Liga victory at Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday. The 30-year-old becomes only the third player in Madrid's history to achieve the feat and a breakdown of the statistics demonstrate just how relentless a goalscorer he is. Sevilla appear to be his favourite opponents, with Ronaldo netting an astonishing 18 times against them since signing for Madrid in 2009. Cristiano Ronaldo (left) scores his 300th goal for Real Madrid in the 2-0 win at Rayo Vallecano . Ronaldo has netted 161 of his goals in the Santiago Bernabeu and 61 between minutes 76 and 90 . Ronaldo (left) enjoyed his most prolific season in 2011-12 with 60 goals but could surpass the total this season . His record against Madrid's biggest rivals is also not to be understated, as he has scored 15 times each against Atletico Madrid and Barcelona. The pair are second on the Portugal international's Madrid hit-list, alongside Getafe. The stats also show Ronaldo's impressive eye for a goal in the final moments of a game, netting an astonishing 61 times between minutes 76 and 90. Over half (161) of his Madrid goals have been scored at the Santiago Bernabeu and he has also found the net 60 times in the Champions League for the club. His most prolific season to date is 2011-12, where he struck 60 goals but Ronaldo could be on track to surpass that total this year. Ronaldo (left) celebrates goal number 300 in his Madrid career with team-mate Gareth Bale . Ronaldo has scored 60 Champions League goals for Madrid and won the competition with the club in 2014 . He has notched 48 strikes already, with eight games remaining in La Liga and at least two in the Champions League, where he will look to continue his impressive scoring spree against city rivals Atletico. Of those eight matches in the league, Ronaldo will face Sevilla again and Getafe, as well as Malaga and Celta Vigo, who he has scored 13 and 12 against respectively.\n",

            "(CNN)Rebekah Gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict. It had been almost two years since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the Boston Marathon, setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others. In court last month, she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street, staring at her own bones. Now, jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath. But no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain, she said. \"I don't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this, no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life,\" she said, crying as she spoke to reporters outside her Texas home. \"I do believe, however, that he should be held accountable for his actions. And I'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that.\" Gregory, who wrote a widely publicized letter to Tsarnaev after testifying, said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories, but it's an important step. \"Everything is being brought up again full force. Our lives will never ever be the same, but I hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason, that there's a bigger plan,\" she said. \"I may be standing on one fake leg, but I'm standing here, stronger than ever, because someone tried to destroy me, and he failed.\" For Gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack, Wednesday's verdict brought a mix of emotions, from triumphant vows to move forward, to expressions of gratitude, to debate over whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. There were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in Boston. In fact, there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats. As Tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head, some survivors and victims' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears. As CNN's Alexandra Field noted from inside the courtroom, \"They've waited a long time for this.\" The family of Sean Collier, a 26-year-old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, were terrorists who \"failed monumentally\" in striking fear in people. \"While today's verdict can never bring Sean back, we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families,\" the Collier family said in a written statement. To Richard \"Dic\" Donohue, an MBTA police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the Tsarnaevs in Watertown, the verdicts show that \"as a society, ... terrorism will not prevail, and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation.\" \"Justice has been served today,\" Donahue tweeted. Survivor Karen Brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal. She doesn't believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's brother Tamerlan, now dead, persuaded him to take part in the plot, as the defense contended. Dzhokhar, in her view, was \"all in.\" \"Obviously we are grateful for the outcome today,\" Brassard tolder reporters. \"It's not a happy occasion, but it's something that we can put one more step behind us.\" That sense of turning the page was echoed by Bruce Mendelsohn, who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line. The verdicts mean that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a \"convicted killer.\" You can't call it celebration. But there is a newfound peace of mind, at least, in and around Boston. This was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt. And they got through it by rallying around each other, a deep bond reflected in the mantra \"Boston Strong.\" That feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by Wednesday's verdict. And it's evident in people like Heather Abbott, who lost her left leg below the knee. Since then, she's become a living example of someone who wasn't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again, but to run again. \"Nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever,\" Abbott said Wednesday on Facebook. \"But at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken.\" That view was commonly shared. For those hurt -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013, Wednesday was key to their progression. But it's not the end of the road. Just ask Jeff Bauman. The picture of him, bloodied, being rushed through the streets of Boston by good Samaritan Carlos Arredondo, became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack. Even after losing both his legs, Bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life, by marrying and fathering a child. On Wednesday, Bauman said the verdict \"will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed.\" \"But it is a relief,\" he added, \"and one step closer to closure.\" CNN's Ann O'Neill and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n",

            "A drunken Alaskan man was arrested after he stole a forklift to retrieve his pickup truck which he'd crashed. Aleksandr Glushko, 21, of Delta Junction  drove for more than three miles while intoxicated to retrieve the truck he'd just crashed. But his bright idea turned sour when an Alaskan Railroad worker spotted him at the wheel of the forklift driving by the crash site, according to The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. Bad idea: The pickup truck driven by Aleksandr Glushko is pictured here after he crashed it in Fairbanks, Alaska, police said the 21-year-old  drove a stolen forklift more than three miles while intoxicated to retrieve it . The railroad worker informed police that he had just seen a man driving a forklift to Illinois Street and the driver had told him he was taking the forklift to get his dad’s truck, which had a flat tire. However, he was arrested by police who were at the scene when he looped back. He has been charged with a felony for driving under the influence of alcohol. According to police, the bizarre incident unfolded just before 6 a.m. Monday, when Glushko  drove off the road in a pickup and crashed into pipe stacked in a company yard. The pickup was left straddling the pipe. Police said Glushko then walked to George Horner Ice Park, where he stole a forklift and drove off with it. Lieutenant Matt Soden from Fairbanks Police Department told the newspaper: 'Police were on scene talking to the railroad worker when Mr. Glushko came driving back up on the forklift.' Glushko was cooperative and agreed to take a breath-alcohol test. It registered 0.230, almost three times the intoxication standard of 0.08, Soden said. He has two prior DUI convictions and was arrested on charges of felony DUI and vehicle theft. He remained in jail Tuesday.\n",

            "How good to welcome Padraig Harrington back to Augusta after a year’s absence, complete with his weird and wonderful practice-ground routines. On Friday, he was at it again, but my favourite moment remains his plaintive lament after a mediocre round: ‘I’m focusing so much on my focus I’m over-focused.’ Padraig Harrington hits a tee shot on the fourth hole during the second day of the Masters on Friday . METH ON THE RISE . Headline writers everywhere will be keeping fingers crossed that golf continues to prove an addiction for the highly rated US Public Links champion Byron Meth, who opened with a 74 on his Masters debut. As for the golfing scribes, we’re just waiting for the blessed day when he meets a lovely girl called Crystal. Byron Meth makes a chip shot on the second hole as the American amateur continues to impress at Augusta . PAR FOUR PROBLEMS . The stats from a brilliant day one made fascinating reading. The par fives are the scoring holes and lived up to their billing since all of them had a scoring average under the regulation mark. The par fours, though, are where you hang on. Half had a scoring average of 4.2 or higher, with the 11th yielding just three birdies all day. TAKING POETIC LICENSE . Top marks to the Augusta Chronicle columnist who wrote a poem about the merchandise pavilion in the 1990s so good he decided to share it with his readers again on Friday. ‘They came, they saw, they bought souvenirs,’ it begins. I know how terribly disappointed you’ll be that space permits me from sharing with you the 23 stanzas that followed. Jordan Spieth marks his ball in the 15th hole during the second round of action at Augusta . NICKLAUS OR ‘99’? In addition to being able to buy an Arnold Palmer as your drink of choice in Augusta you can now have Jack Nicklaus ice cream for dessert. No word yet, however, on when Bubba Watson’s Marmite or Ben Crenshaw’s treacle hits the shelves. As for Tiger Woods, he’ll surely launch his own iced lolly soon. Jack Nicklaus waves to the crowd before hitting off on the first tee during the honorary starters ceremony . AUGUSTA SEES REDS . It is not just former Liverpool captain Jamie Redknapp who’s enjoying these sacred acres this week but the club’s greatest ever player as well. I’m going to guess mad-keen golfer Kenny Dalglish was quite happy when wife Marina produced tickets as an anniversary present. Patrons watch the play at the 16th hole during a thrilling second day of play in Augusta .\n",

            "Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China . Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .\n",

            "The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button. Diana’s final wishes for the disposal of her £21.4 million estate are among a vast archive of wills dating back to 1858 now available to view online. Those of Winston Churchill and George Orwell can also be seen. In her will, Diana’s butler Paul Burrell was bequeathed the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax. Scroll down for video . The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button thanks to a new service . Possessions including paintings and a clock were distributed among her 17 godchildren, while the rest went to her sons William and Harry. Qadir Ahmed runs the secure Iron Mountain facility in a leafy suburb of Birmingham where row upon row of the documents are kept in temperature-controlled storage, under tight security. He said the wills are a fascinating snapshot into the personalities and characters of people from every walk of life. For some, having a copy of a will is a matter of sentimentality, whereas others - particularly in the case of celebrities - are ordered out of 'pure curiosity', he said. 'We have 41 million in storage and there are so many fascinating and emotional stories,' said Mr Ahmed. One such is that of the late Paul Hunter, the champion snooker player, who died of cancer in 2006 aged just 27. Paul Burrell was given £50,000 by Diana when she died . The Yorkshireman fathered a daughter who, at the time he penned his will, was not yet born but she is remembered in the passages of his will, as Mr Ahmed describes. 'There are some really touching stories inside these files - people like Paul Hunter, who in his will says 'To my unborn child, I leave ...' and that is genuinely touching. 'He believed at the time he was writing this will, that he wouldn't survive the birth of his child.' 'You feel the emotion of that moment, through reading the record.' The first disbursement of Diana's will reads: 'I bequeath to my butler Paul Burrell the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax.' It also provides for specified keepsakes including watercolour paintings and a carriage clock to be distributed among her 17 godchildren, while to Princes William and Harry she left everything else. In the event of her death she makes express provision the Prince of Wales 'will consult with my mother [Frances Shand Kydd] with regard to the upbringing, education and welfare of our children'. She also makes clear her wish to be buried. Mr Ahmed said the new system, which has been in place since the end of last year, means people no longer have to order wills by post, or by heading to their local Registry Office. 'A lot of the public are not aware these are public records,' he said. 'Once someone goes through probate, that's it. It's a simple process, through the gov.uk website. 'You can pay a small fee of £10 and order a record of anyone who's gone through probate, searching by the person's name and year of death.' Among the other celebrity wills, are those of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, creator of Winnie the Pooh AA Milne and George Orwell - under his real name Eric Blair - who penned 1984. Data centre manager Qadir Ahmed inspects one of the more than 41 million public wills held in secure storage at the Iron Mountain facility in Birmingham . Churchill, who died in 1965, left an estate worth £266,054 which he asked to be divided between his wife and children. He gave his country home Chartwell, in Kent, to the National Trust to be a museum after his death. As well as other bequests of cash to his wife, children, family and friends, he also left money to his employees, including £100 for his gardener. His son-in-law, Arthur Christopher John Soames, was given 'such of my brood mares, followers and fillies' from Churchill's stable, but with the caveat his choices were \"not exceeding three in number, nor £7,500 in total value'. Also stored away is the will of wartime code-breaker Alan Turing, recently played in Hollywood movie The Imitation Game by Benedict Cumberbatch. Turing's brief final testament directs his possessions be left to close friends and his mother. Meanwhile, Orwell - listed under his birth name Blair - left instructions 'no biography be written' and 'no memorial service be held for me after my death'.\n",

            "Forget sunbathing, now you can spend your holiday learning to strip. Burlesque queen Dita Von Teese is offering burlesque workshops at Canyon Ranch, a luxury health resort in Tucson, Arizona. With an emphasis on self-confidence boosting, the forty two-year-old fashion designer and author famous for her raunchy routines will run presentations and classes incorporating the principles of modern burlesque - the 'art form' she famously revived. Dita von Teese will offer guests at the Canyon Ranch an insight into the glamorous world of burlesque . Sensuality & the Art of the Teese with Dita Von Teese will invite female guests to unleash their inner divas with a selection of workshops and classes. Von Teese, real name Heather Renée Sweet, will team up with burlesque teacher Catherine D'Lish, to offer ranch guests a striptease workshop. From June 8 until June 12, holidaymakers to the ranch - more famous for holistic body treatments than nipple tassels - can learn classic moves such as the 'burlesque strut' as well as how to artfully remove garters, gloves and stockings. Von Teese, real name Heather Renée Sweet, will team up with burlesque teacher Catherine D'Lish, to offer ranch guests a striptease workshop . Canyon Ranch, the luxury health resort in Tucson, Arizona, where Dita Von Teese will lead her workshops . Instead of hitting the resort's fitness centre, plucky holidaymakers can take part in a Fit Strip class, hosted by Von Teese herself, along with fitness staff from the ranch. And for those wanting a deeper understanding of American burlesque, which first gained popularity as early as 1860, there will be history sessions, during which Von Teese will show guests treasured items from her personal collection of memorabilia. 'We are thrilled that Dita chose to lead her first-ever burlesque workshop at Canyon Ranch in Tucson,' Canyon Ranch's director of public relations told Mail Online Travel. More oo-er than ohm: Von Teese believes her burlesque workshops can build women's confidence . Finding peace: Canyon Ranch health resort in Tuscon is an 150 acre haven in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona . 'We are confident that this program will appeal to our current guests as well as those who’ve never before visited Canyon Ranch.' Von Teese told the New York Times: 'It really has nothing to do with my performance, but more to do with sharing where my motivations and confidence come from, and trying to explain what it is about burlesque that’s become such a uniquely modern feminist movement.' A five-night stay at Canyon Ranch costs $5,460 (around £3565) per person  including accommodation, meals, airport transfers and spa treatments and unlimited classes.\n",

            "(CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. \"The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,\" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. \"It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence.\" The report, \"Death Sentences and Executions 2014,\" cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its \"Strike Hard\" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. \"The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),\" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. \"A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition.\" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, \"against scores of people in some cases.\" The organization found \"positive developments\" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. \"Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,\" Gaughran said. \"Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region.\" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes \"thousands\" of prisoners each year, \"more than the rest of the world put together.\" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. \"In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,\" the report stated. \"In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.\" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. \"The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,\" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. \"We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights.\" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.\n",

            "(CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. \"That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror,\" Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. \"In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests,\" the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. \"But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful.\" Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. \"The timing is beyond a coincidence,\" he said. \"We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward.\" Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. \"The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA,\" he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, \"Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?\" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a \"fix\" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.\n",

            "A mother was horrified to find a dead gecko stuck to the lining of a jacket she bought from Asda. Paula Dunican spent £25 on the baby blue coat at her local branch in Canterbury, Kent. But when the 49-year-old took it home to try on, she noticed a dark stain 'seeping through' from the its lining. Inside, a four inch-long gecko was flattened, its scales imprinted onto the fabric. Paula Dunican was horrified when she found the body of a crushed lizard on the lining of a £25 coat from Asda . 'I noticed the coat had a stain on the back seeping through, so I opened it and stuck to the lining was a shrivelled, squashed lizard,' said Mrs Dunican. 'I think it must have been ironed - it was disgusting.' The supermarket has offered her a refund and £40 voucher, adding that the reptile may have climbed into one of the boxes transporting clothes from Vietnam where they are made. Its quality control department said it was waiting for Mrs Dunican, who is a school learning support assistant, to return the garment. In 2012 another Asda customer found a dead cockroach inside a kettle she had bought to sterilise baby items. Mrs Dunican said the reptile looked as though it had been ironed onto the coat. A spokesman for Asda apologised and offered her a £40 voucher and refund . Carly Wintle bought the own brand appliance in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, and found the insect inside after unwrapping it. Meanwhile in February a disgusted shopper found the severed head of a frozen rat in a bag of frozen spinach. Terri Powis, 33, was horrified when she opened the bag and found the rodent's decomposing body. The supermarket apologised and asked her to return the item to the store, acting, she said, as though it happened 'every day', the Mirror reported.\n",

            "For the first time, astronomers have found the building blocks of life  in a distant early star system. Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disk of gas and dust around a star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system. Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disc of gas around an infant star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system . Radio telescope observations showed the disk surrounding the million-year-old star MWC 480 to be 'brimming' with the complex carbon-based molecule methyl cyanide. Both this molecule and its simpler organic cousin hydrogen cyanide were identified in the cold outer reaches of the newly formed disc. The region can be compared with our solar system's Kuiper Belt, a realm of icy mini-worlds and comets beyond Neptune. Experts believe comets and asteroids from the outer solar system seeded the young Earth with water and organic molecules to set the stage for life to evolve. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480. Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive . Astronomer Dr Karin Oberg, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Massachusetts, said: 'Studies of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our sun and planets was rich in water and complex organic compounds. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington yesterday, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' 'We now have evidence that this same chemistry exists elsewhere in the universe, in regions that could form solar systems not unlike our own.' The molecules surrounding MWC 480 have been detected in similar concentrations in our own solar system's comets, she pointed out. The star, which is about twice as massive as the sun, lies in a well-studied star-forming region in the constellation Taurus. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480. Previously it was unclear whether complex organic molecules commonly survive the shocks and radiation levels found in a newly forming solar system . Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive. The findings, reported in the journal Nature, reveal that there is enough methyl cyanide around MWC 480 to fill all of the Earth's oceans. Among complex organic molecules, cyanides - especially methyl cyanide - are important because they contain carbon-nitrogen bonds essential for the formation of amino acids, the components of proteins. As the MWC 480 system evolves it is likely that organic molecules locked away in comets and other icy bodies will be ferried closer to the star where conditions may be suitable for life, the scientists believe. Dr Oberg added: 'From the study of exoplanets, we know our solar system isn't unique in having rocky planets and an abundance of water. 'Now we know we're not unique in organic chemistry. Once more, we have learned that we're not special. From a life in the universe point of view, this is great news.'\n",

            "David Cameron will today warn English voters the SNP's new powers could impact their lives . David Cameron will today risk infuriating the SNP by vowing to conduct an annual review of the fairness of the Scottish government’s policies on the rest of the UK. A Conservative government would create a new principle to ensure decisions by Holyrood do not have an ‘unforeseen detrimental effect’ for people south of the border, he will say. The Prime Minister will tell voters in England that new powers for the Scottish Parliament mean it ‘can now have a big impact on your job, your income, and investment in your area’. Mr Cameron will call the idea the ‘Carlisle Principle’ – named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the UK that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the Scottish government. There has been growing resentment in England and Wales at the ‘apartheid’ between those living north and south of the border in areas such as healthcare and university fees. For instance, cancer drugs have been made available on the NHS in Scotland that are not prescribed elsewhere, meaning taxpayers in England and Wales are contributing to funding them, but not benefiting. The Scottish Parliament’s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of England being unfairly disadvantaged – and require targeted tax cuts, Mr Cameron will say. However, Scottish Nationalists are likely to accuse Mr Cameron of wanting Westminster to ‘mark the Scottish Parliament’s homework’ every year. He will also be accused of seeking to stoke anti-Scottish sentiment in the rest of the UK – and throwing fuel on the fire of Scottish nationalism. The Tory manifesto promises to introduce a principle of ‘English votes for English laws’, meaning English MPs will be given a veto over legislation relating solely to England. Under Mr Cameron’s latest plan, a formal assessment would be made by the Treasury and Cabinet Office each year of the impact of Scottish policies, including tax rates, business levies, university tuition fees and healthcare. Mr Cameron risks the wrath of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured above) with his announcement . The Chancellor will tell MPs ‘what action is needed to make sure there is no detriment to the rest of the country’. The Prime Minister, on a campaign visit to the North West, will insist the plan will not stop the Scottish government taking the decisions it wants. ‘In the Scottish referendum, we made a clear promise to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament,’ Mr Cameron will say. ‘After we won that referendum, we kept our promise, and agreement was reached – for the first time – between all five of Scotland’s major parties to give the Scottish Parliament extensive new powers. ‘But as we go further in devolving powers to Scotland, we need to make sure devolution works for all the other all parts of this country too. ‘Today I want to set out a new principle – you could call it the Carlisle Principle – that we will make sure that there are no unforeseen detrimental consequences to the rest of the country from Scottish devolution.’ Boris Johnson and Sir John Major will enter the election fray this week as the Tories try to bolster their campaign. Sir John will warn of the dangers of a Labour-SNP government. The ex-premier could be deployed to speak as early as tomorrow. Later in the week, David Cameron is due to make a first high-profile campaign appearance with Mr Johnson. There are growing calls from Tory MPs for the London mayor to be ‘weaponised’. David Cameron has revealed he is locked in a high stakes battle: over ear-piercing. While contesting a general election campaign, he is also in a 'fight' with eldest daughter Nancy about when she can have her ears pierced. The Prime Minister also admitted he does not want his children to follow wife Samantha in having tattoo. In an interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said his children 'take the mickey out of me daily', including mocking his TV and music choices. 'To them I'm just a normal dad, who they think is a bit square and sometimes embarrassing. It's very sobering to come home to after a day in the office,' he said. 'They rib me about, you know, anything from my CD collection to what I watch on TV.' Nancy is due to start secondary school in September, and wants to have her ears pierced. Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in that fight with Nancy at the moment. We'll probably reach an agreement over what age she can have them done. We're in negotiations.' His wife Samantha has a small tattoo of a dolphin on her right ankle, which she had done while travelling as a student. She has said it would 'fine' if her children copied her. But Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not a big fan. I love Samantha's tattoo, it's very small, very discreet. But I'd be a square dad and tell the children to think very carefully about it.'\n",

            "A family overheard a terrifying message on their young son's baby monitor after the device and its camera were hacked. When the Washington couple's three-year-old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night, his parents had put it down to their toddler's over-active imagination, reported CBS New York. That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' A couple heard the terrifying message: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you' come through their 3-year-old son's baby monitor (stock image) And the horrified parents, who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down, believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked. They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. After the first creepy message, the boy's mother had walked into the room and overheard the hacker saying, 'Look someone's coming' or 'Someone's coming into view.' The mother said she broke down in tears after the realization hit home that a total stranger was able to control the camera to watch their son and spy on them. The stranger had managed to hack the baby monitor and the family says the hacker was even able to remotely control the camera on the monitor (stock image) She told CBS New York: 'Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out.' They reported the incident to Foscam, the company where they bought their monitor, who admitted it was possible the device's cameras were being controlled remotely but they could not say from where. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. 'It's basically like they're standing next to you in your house,' Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable,CBS. He warned that parents should change the passwords on the devices to make it more difficult for people to guess. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children . 'If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,' Ulanoff said. Earlier this month, another couple - this time from Rochester, Minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online, according to Redbook. They first became suspicious after they heard music coming in from their baby's room. 'We were sleeping in bed, and basically heard music coming from the nursery, but then when we went into the room the music turned off,' she told KTTC. When she tracked down the IP address which was streaming the music, she found a web link to a page with thousands of pictures from baby monitors all over the world, including several from her own child's nursery. 'There's at least fifteen different countries listed and it's not just nurseries—it's people's living rooms, their bedrooms, their kitchens,' she explained. 'Every place that people think is sacred and private in their home is being accessed.'\n",

            "A Chinese villager who was desperate to become a grandfather has been arrested for buying a wife for his son, then reselling her to another family after realising she was infertile. The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time. Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village. 'The whole thing is pathetic and detestable,' said Guo Jialun, head of the Guanyun County police station. The police is currently trying to track down Wang's real family.\n",

            "Nasa has released the first close-up views of the north pole of dwarf planet Ceres from the Dawn spacecraft. Dawn arrived on 6 March, the first time a spacecraft has orbited a dwarf planet, and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission. However, the images have not yet revealed what the mystery ‘bright spots’ on the surface of the world are, which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike. Nasa scientists in California have released new images of Ceres (shown). They were taken by the Dawn spacecraft from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km). The spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to Ceres. And it will soon study the whole planet - including its mystery bright spots . The latest images were taken on 10 April from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km), and are the highest-resolution views of Ceres so far. The spacecraft is currently on the side of the planet that is mostly shrouded in darkness, but over the coming months it will see more of the world in light. And it will also see Ceres in better and a higher resolution. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. It is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star, allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres because it is seen as being a record of the early solar system, and may also have shifting ice on its surface. Ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with an average diameter of 590 miles (950km). Dawn has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May. After this, it will begin making lower and lower orbits to get better views of the surface. The mission will allow scientists to study the last major body between Earth and Jupiter that has yet to be explored. 'The mission is so exciting, because we're exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system,' Dr Marc Rayman, Dawn chief engineer and mission director at JPL told MailOnline. 'For me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries, a mysterious world of rock and ice, perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds, lakes or oceans, is very exciting.' Shown above is an animation of Ceres rotating as Dawn observed its north pole. Ceres is about 2.8 times further from the sun than Earth, and a day on the dwarf planet lasts nine Earth hours. Credit: Nasa . Dawn (artist's illustration shown) has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May . In the next few weeks and months, the dwarf planet will be studied in great detail. But the most impressive images will be returned in December, when Dawn starts one of its lowest science orbits. It will be at an altitude of just 225 miles (360km) above the surface - below the orbital height of the International Space Station around Earth - allowing it to get high resolution images of the surface. The primary science mission for the spacecraft will last until June 2016 - by which the team expects to have achieved all of its scientific goals -and it is unlikely the spacecraft will be extended beyond that date, as it will probably start running out of fuel by then. This map-projected view of Ceres was created from images taken by Nasa's Dawn spacecraft during its initial approach to the dwarf planet, prior to being captured into orbit in March 2015. Differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest Ceres was once an active body . Perhaps of most interest, though, are the mystery bright spots on the surface. These are thought to possibly be expanses of ice inside a crater on Ceres. Based on new infrared images released by Nasa the other day, it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties - suggesting they have different origins. They could also be towering ‘water volcanoes’, but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. These images, from Dawn's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR), highlight two regions on Ceres containing bright spots. The images suggest they coudl be towering ‘water volcanoes’, but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this . 'The bright spots [seen in this previous Nasa image] continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles .\n",

            "Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon has long been a fortress with no team scoring there in the Champions League for 663 minutes. Last season the now Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was the reason for that but now the man keeping the clean sheets is Jan Oblak. Sportsmail looks at the 22-year-old who has made Atletico fans forget about Courtois... and David De Gea. No one knew too much about him last season outside of Portugal and Slovenia so was it a gamble? You only have to look at his price tag to see how highly-rated he was. He cost €16million (£11.5m) and that is a La Liga record for a goalkeeper. The 22-year-old was already Slovenia's number one when he left Benfica for Madrid in the summer. With experienced goalkeepers such as Petr Cech and Pepe Reina potentially available, going for a young relatively untried keeper looked a gamble but he already looks to have been money well spent. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Oblak gets down low to keep out a shot from Real Madrid's James Rodriguez in the second half . A success right from the start of the season? No. Simeone likes to ease in new signings especially when they are young and 31-year-old Miguel Moya was signed from Getafe in the close season as back-up. But the back-up became first choice because Oblak had a right hip injury in pre-season and wasn't 100 per cent when the campaign started. Moya played in the league with Oblak coming in for Champions League games but in his first match in Europe he conceded three goals from three shots. He has recovered brilliantly and now the clamour is for him to start all matches. Cristiano Ronaldo is thwarted in his attempt to open the scoring against rivals Atletico Madrid . He has convinced everyone in Madrid? Simeone's number two Mono Burgos is a big fan. The Argentine is a former Atletico keeper and although he doesn't train the goalkeepers he is convinced Atletico have found someone who can keep goal for them for years to come. Pablo Vercellone who is the club's keeping coach is just as excited and even Iker Casillas is a fan. The Real Madrid keeper said after Tuesday's game: 'He was fantastic in the first 45 minutes. We deserved more reward from all the chances we had but we didn't get it because he played so well.' Oblak put in an impressive performance for Atletico against their great rivals Madrid on Tuesday . And it really was a very special first half. Atletico have not allowed a team to get six shots on target in one half of football all season but he stopped them all. He also made two more stops in the second half when most of the football was being played at the other end and he had to stay awake. Has he fitted into the dressing room? He speaks some English, some Portuguese, and some Spanish so he can make himself understood without problems. Still only 22 and living his first year in Spain he is predictably introverted but has a strong enough personality to impose himself on his defence. Oblak  stops Bale's attempt on goal during the Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday . Other strengths? We saw the shot stopping on Wednesday but his distribution is also a weapon for Atletico. They were camped in their own half in the first 45 minutes against Real unable to get their passing going. Oblak's long – and importantly accurate – throws and kicks forward to Mario Mandzukic were an important release. How good can he become? So good he'll be sold? Atletico have already lost two brilliant keepers in De Gea who they could only keep for one season and Courtois who they were not able to take from Chelsea. They will not want to lost Oblak and with foreign investment from the Wanda group in China the club does not have to sell it's best players – he's at Atletico for good. Atletico lost two brilliant keepers in De Gea  and Courtois but the future looks bright with Oblak .\n",

            "A neo-Nazi charged with killing a gay supervisor at a community college said he did so because he hates homosexuality. Stancil, who gave himself fascist face tattoos, is awaiting extradition from Florida to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane. Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, told Raleigh's WRAL-TV on Wednesday that he killed Lane earlier this week in North Carolina because Lane had made sexual advances to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Scroll down for video . Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, claimed in a prison interview on Wednesday that he had killed a gay college supervisor because he made sexual advances towards his teenage brother . In a telephone interview from a Daytona Beach jail, Stancil said Lane tried to take advantage of his brother. 'He ain't physically touched him, but he was in the proposal to try to and I wasn't going to let that happen,' Stancil said. Stancil said Lane was looking for Stancil on Facebook and found his brother. A Goldsboro police spokesman did not immediately return a phone message on Thursday about that allegation. 'I'd do anything necessary to take care of my family,' Stancil said. He said he has no regrets about the shooting. 'I did what I did, and I've got to live with it. If I get life, I just get life. 'I'm a murderer, you know, what the hell do I got to care? 'I don't give a damn if I go back to society.' Stancil, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane (pictured) and claimed to have killed three others - although police had no reports of unsolved homicides . Stancil said he is a neo-Nazi who is concerned about the future of white children. 'I try to look out for my fellow white people,' he said. 'I don't believe in race mixing.' He was asked if he hates gays. 'Yes, I do, with a passion,' he replied, though he said that was only one of the reasons he killed Lane, who had been his supervisor in a work study program at the college before he was fired for absenteeism. Stancil also told the television station he had killed three other people, including two in the Wayne County area. But the sheriff's department told the station it has no report of any unsolved homicides that match Stancil's account. The accused killer appeared in court in Florida on Tuesday where he admitted to the killing, WRAL reported, despite the judge advising him he could remain silent. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth'. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Lane was gay, and authorities said they are investigating a possible hate crime. They haven't released a motive for the shooting, but Stancil was dismissed from a work study program at the print shop last month. His mother, Debbie Stancil, said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son. 'He was verbally inappropriate with Morgan at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' The 20-year-old is facing a charge of open murder. Stancil pictured with his mother Debbie at his graduation. She said he is 'rattled and confused and needs mental help'. The mother also claimed that the victim had made sexually laced comments to her son .\n",

            "The brass lamp is being sold at auction in June by auctioneers Hansons (above with model in period costume) A brass desk lamp used by Florence Nightingale as she wrote about her nursing experiences in the Crimean War is to be sold at auction. It was given as a gift to two sisters who worked as servants for the Nightingale family at Lea Hurst, near Matlock, Derbyshire. Dating back to around 1840, the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, on June 26. After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire, where she had spent her childhood, in the 1850s. She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today. During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times. She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari, now Istanbul, in 1854 to care for soldiers. She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt. It was there Nightingale earned her nickname, carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital's patients through the night. The lamp from her Derbyshire home was passed down through generations of the Lea Hurst servants' family. Auctineer Charles Hanson said: ‘The lamp is quite remarkable. It has a wonderful provenance, which confirms it helped ignite Florence and her writings late into many a Derbyshire night. 'Such an iconic object and it’s association with such a leading lady will be guided at £1000-2000. With interest and competition it may just ignite, since it is such a wonderful object.' Florence Nightingale penned nursing notes at her Derbyshire home after returning from the Crimean War .\n",

            "The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has denied that partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities. Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor. 'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu. Officials (L-r) European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, and an unidentified Russian official, look on as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland . The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'. America's sanctions on Iran relating to 'terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles' will remain in place.\n",

            "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.\n",

            "Disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman (pictured) is said to have played the race card to silence opponents - and his deputy today reiterated claims there is deep seated racism in the borough of Tower Hamlets, in east London . A deputy of disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman yesterday appeared to blame the vote-rigging scandal on ‘institutional racism’. Oliur Rahman, who took over from the deposed leader yesterday, insisted there was deep-rooted racism within the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. His comment was at odds with a devastating legal ruling that condemned his predecessor for bribery and ballot fraud and found he had repeatedly ‘played the race card’ to silence critics. The two men – who are not related – are both members of the Tower Hamlets First party. Political opponents said they were playing the same ‘cracked record’ by seeking to blame racism and Islamophobia for their problems. Oliur Rahman told the BBC: ‘If people say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, then they are very much mistaken because there is institutional racism. ‘If people want to turn a blind eye to the racism then that’s their decision but they are very much mistaken if they turn round and say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, and that people are not judged because of their skin colour and their religion.’ On Thursday, electoral judge Richard Mawrey QC found that Lutfur Rahman, 49, and his cronies had rigged the 2014 mayoral ballot by creating an army of ‘ghost voters’, forging postal votes, bribing Muslim voters and using religious intimidation against them and branding opponents as racists. He found that all the councillors from the Tower Hamlets First party were elected corruptly. Oliur Rahman, 34, a former councillor for George Galloway’s Respect party but now a Tower Hamlets First councillor, emailed his fellow members yesterday to declare himself acting mayor until new elections. He said: ‘Following the verdict, I have assumed the executive role within the council, until a mayoral election is held.’ Peter Golds, the leader of the Tory group in Tower Hamlets, said: ‘Oliur Rahman ought to be hanging his head in shame and apologising to the borough, but I don’t think he gets it. ‘It’s ludicrous to play the race card again. They roll out this hoary old chestnut every time anything happens. The real unpleasant racism has come from the ranks of Tower Hamlets First. ‘They’ve got one cracked record, that any criticism of them is Islamophobic and racist. Now they’re playing it again, despite the court case. Nothing has changed.’ Lutfur Rahman, who was Britain’s first elected Muslim mayor, has met lawyers to discuss seeking a judicial review of the Election Court’s decision that he was responsible for bribery and voter fraud. Supporters said he continued to deny any wrongdoing. Police have been urged to launch a fresh investigation into fraud in the 2014 mayoral election, which will be re-run in June. Lutfur Rahman, a Bangladesh-born former Labour council leader, has been banned from running for public office, or even voting, for five years. Four voters launched legal action against him after complaints that police and the Electoral Commission had failed to act. Andy Erlam - who launched legal action against the mayor with Angela Moffat and Azmal Hussein (pictured left to right) - said Oliur Rahman was in 'complete denial' The group was headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket. Mr Erlam said Lutfur Rahman’s supporters – including Oliur Rahman – were in ‘complete denial’. He added: ‘They are still claiming Rahman didn’t do anything wrong despite a devastating judgment by a respected High Court judge who spent six weeks considering the dreadful evidence. ‘It makes me shudder to think they were in charge of a £1.3billion budget of taxpayers’ money.’\n",

            "(CNN)Most kids want to go out and play when they finish their homework early. But Zuriel Oduwole isn't \"most kids.\" When she gets ahead of her work, she packs her camera and microphones, jumps on a plane and interviews presidents instead. Born in California to a Nigerian father and a Mauritian mother, Oduwole is often described as \"the world's youngest filmmaker.\" Aged 12, she already has four documentaries under her belt -- all of which focus on African issues. It all started three years ago when Oduwole decided to enter a school documentary-making competition with a film about the Ghana revolution. Jerry John Rawlings (Ghana) John Kufour (Ghana) Joyce Banda (Malawi) Jakaya Kikwete (Tanzania) Rajkeswur Purryag (Mauritius) Uhuru Kenyatta (Kenya) Goodluck Johnathan (Nigeria) Salva Kirr Mayardit (South Sudan) Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia) Jorge Fonseco (Cape Verde) Portia Simpson Miller (Jamaica) Thomas Thabane (Lesotho) Ralph Gonsalves (St Vincent & Grenadines) Denzil Douglas (St Kitts & Nevis) After this first foray into filmmaking, Oduwole was bitten by the director's bug and quickly wanted to make more movies. She turned to the web to find the tools she needed and got involved in the entire filmmaking process. \"As I edit, produce, set up and write the scripts for my documentaries, I have to learn a lot of things,\" says Oduwole, who is self-taught and uses online editing and voice software. Her second outing, \"Educating and Healing Africa Out of Poverty,\" looked at the creation of the African Union in 1963. She followed it up in 2014 with her movie \"Technology in Educational Development.\" But it was her most recent project that catapulted her to international recognition. Released late last year, \"A Promising Africa\" (watch trailer below) is the first in an ongoing series which will profile five African nations, starting with her father's homeland of Nigeria. \"I've interviewed 14 heads of state and a few of those include the President of Tanzania, Liberia, Kenya, South Sudan, Nigeria and Cape Verde, to name a few,\" says Oduwole. \"I've also been able to interview business leaders like my friend Mr Aliko Dangote.\" To date, \"A Promising Africa\" has received a limited-release on the big screen in five countries -- Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, UK and Japan. The young trailblazer, who was named by Business Insider as one of world's 100 most powerful individuals last year, delightedly recalls seeing her film on the big screen and walking the red carpet in Lagos. \"I'm hoping that when people see these documentaries they will see Africa is full of positive things -- not just the things that are on the news like war, famine, disease,\" she says. \"I want to show them there is a lot more to Africa than what we see on the news -- there's dancing, music, great culture and more.\" Although she's just 12, Oduwole, who is home-schooled through an online Californian system, is already a 9th grader -- two years ahead of the rest of the kids her age. Her mother, Patricia, has a full-time job as a computer engineer, whilst her father, Ademola, has taken time off his work in the tourism sector to help organize a lot of what Zuriel and her three other siblings are doing. \"There really is a lot happening in our household but somehow we make it work,\" says Patricia Oduwole. In addition to her documentary work, Oduwole has also become something of an education advocate. She travels to different African countries and the diaspora on a regular basis to talk to students about the importance of education. So far, through her side project \"Dream Up, Speak Up, Stand Up\" she says she's had the opportunity to talk to 21,000 children in nine countries. \"Girl's education is important because on the African continent, where there are not as many resources, the boys are the first [to get an education],\" says Oduwole. \"The boys go to school and get an education while the girls stay at home. And those girls aren't educated and have fewer options in life when they get older.\" More from African Voices .\n",

            "Manchester United star Ryan Giggs has apologised to his brother for the eight-year affair he had with his  wife. His apology came nearly four years after bedding her for the last time. Ryan, 41, phoned Rhodri, 38, and the two brothers are now reconciling in an attempt to rebuild their relationship. Celebrity Big Brother star: Natasha Giggs had an eight-year affair with football legend Ryan Giggs . Reconciliation: Rhodri (left) and brother Ryan (right) have ended their four-year feud over the affair . A source told the Sun newspaper that 'Ryan rang Rhodri out of the blue a few weeks ago. Rhodri moved on a long time ago but was adamant Ryan had to make the first move as he was the one who had done wrong.' On Easter Sunday the two brothers were spotted out together with friends at the Neighbourhood bar in Manchester. A clubber said: 'They were sitting in the VIP area and looked like they were enjoying each other's company again.' Happy families: Ryan with wife Stacey Cooke on the red carpet in 2011 before the affair revelations . High Court injunction battle: Ryan Giggs spent £150,000 trying to silence Big Brother star Imogen Thomas from revealing details of their affair . Rhodri with his wife Natasha before he knew about her eight-year affair with his brother Ryan . The affair was first revealed in June 2011 when Rhodri's wife Natasha admitted an eight-year affair with the former star winger. Natasha also said she had aborted Ryan's baby just weeks before she got married to Rhodri in Las Vegas. She decided to go public in 2011 after Ryan Giggs' controversial attempt to place a gagging order on Big Brother star Imogen Thomas after their six-month affair ended. Ryan Giggs' attempt at silencing Imogen Thomas backfired when a Twitter campaign resulted in an MP naming him in parliament . He spent £150,000 getting a High Court injunction against her. However, his attempt to silence her fell apart after a sustained Twitter campaign that resulted in an MP naming him in parliament. In January 2012, Natasha went on to Celebrity Big Brother, where she openly talked about the affair to her fellow housemates. Ryan lives with wife Stacey and their two children in a £4m mansion. He is currently part of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal’s backroom staff with his side third in the Barclays Premier League. Natasha originally left Rhodri but the two later unsuccessfully tried to reconcile, and they divorced in 2013. Natasha, 32, had a son last year with a new partner. Rhodri is now married to Ashleigh Turner, 24, and they have a baby son. Much happier times: Ryan (left) with his  brother Rhodri (right) as young children before their fallout . Ryan Giggs (left) now works as the Manchester United assistant manager to Louis van Gaal (right) Yesterday he was banned from driving for six months, after being caught driving his Mercedes with no insurance  in Ardwick near Manchester. Manchester Magistrates Court also ordered him to pay £215 in fines and costs. He told the court he would lose his job as a HGV driver for an agency if he lost his licence. 'I’ve been awaiting the outcome of this. It’s been difficult. They only allow certain people to drive for them. I will lose my job if I lost my licence,' he said. 'It’s not exceptional hardship but I would obviously have to find something else.'\n",

            "Cheesy slogans such as ‘reach for the stars’ could be detrimental to pupils, it has been claimed. Carl Hendrick, head of learning and research at Wellington College, Berkshire, has attacked the ‘tidal wave of guff’ in classrooms. These ‘missives in mediocrity’ often tell pupils to ‘live your dream’ and ‘you can do it’ and ‘be all that you can be’. Cheesy slogans such as ‘reach for the stars’ on posters in schools could be detrimental to pupils, it has been claimed. Above, a stock image of a motivational poster . But the glossy notices are ‘often reductively misinterpreted as “you can achieve anything if you believe”’. Mr Hendrick argues that schools should concentrate on boosting pupils’ confidence by teaching them well and providing ‘clear and achievable paths to academic success’. Writing in a blog, he claimed that motivational posters ‘sit alongside a set of approaches that may well be doing more harm than good’. But Vic Goddard, headmaster of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, and star of Educating Essex, told the Times Educational Supplement he is a fan of the posters. Mr Hendrick argues that schools should concentrate on boosting pupils’ confidence by teaching them well and providing ‘clear and achievable paths to academic success’. Above, a stock image of three confident pupils . He has one outside his room saying: ‘I am not telling you it is going to be easy, but I am telling you it is going to be worth it.’ It comes as teachers have been told they must not talk about getting fat or compliment colleagues on losing weight in front of pupils, Government-backed guidance said. They should also avoid discussing ‘unflattering photos of celebrities’, how ageing ravages people’s looks and ‘fat-shaming’ youngsters. The advice is supposed to help pupils develop positive body images amid ‘society’s intense focus on physical appearance’.\n",

            "Sauntering down leafy avenues past typical Dutch step-­gabled buildings, carpets of crocuses, the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal, I can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than The Hague. This is also prime territory for a gallery­ lover like me: the beautiful, elegant and not-­too-­big Mauritshuis was restored last year. This is also the home of Girl With A Pearl Earring, the 'Dutch Mona Lisa'. But I am not only here for the Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals. Much more than a village: The Parliament Building stands proud in The Hague - a hidden gem of a city . There is the Escher gallery (devoted to that geometry-­defying genius), the contemporary art Gemeentemuseum and more. Meanwhile, I am being charmed by an unsuspected delight: this medieval city by the sea. 'City? This is Europe's biggest village,' says my guide, Remco Dörr. He is right: The Hague, despite being home to Holland's royal family and an eye-­catching parliament, was classed as a village until Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon's brother and king of Holland) set up here in 1806. It has a genteel moat/canal, which encircles the historic centre. We step across and in front of an approaching car, which slows down deferentially. Remco tells me that many traffic lights have been taken out for aesthetic reasons. 'Now, the cars are very careful,' he says. The Hague is home to one of the cornerstones of European art - Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring . You have to love that kind of Dutch logic - though it doesn't seem to apply to cyclists, who rule the place. Next time, I will rent a bicycle, although the trams and buses are easy and cheap (an all-day pass costs €7.70/£5.60). Over the moat, we are in Noordeinde street. Remco ushers me into what used to be part of a palace, and still has huge chandeliers and ornate mirrors. This cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes (I snacked in the Juni Lekkernijen), as well as altogether more assuming ones. HanTing is the latest Michelin star in town and the best place for Indonesian cuisine. The most prized Dutch colony was apparently run from The Hague (aka 'the Widow of Indonesia'). For summer: the excellent Grapes & Olives and the Café de Bieb on Veenkade will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal, with music and boat trips planned, including a tour at the Kompaan brewery (I can vouch for the product). My art gorging finishes at the Panorama, an extraordinary, 14 ft-­high circular panorama of The Hague's seaside resort, Scheveningen, painted by Hendrik Mesdag. I take a 15-minute tram to the place itself and gorge on scallops and sole at Catch by Simonis on the harbour front. The Hague has netted a new fan. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Rotterdam Den Haag (half-hour taxi) from £100 return. For tours with Remco Dörr, email remco.dorr@­hotmail.com.

            "An ancient statue of the wife of China's first ruler is damaged - after tourists kept rubbing the woman's exposed breast. Officials have complained the bronze sculpture of Yu The Great's wife has been worn down and discolored by sightseers constantly fondling the artwork, reports The People's Daily. The statue, which stands in a gardens in Wuhan, the capital city of central China’s Hubei Province, is to honour Yu The Great, who founded China's first dynasty in 2070 BC. Officials in Wuhan, the capital city of central China’s Hubei Province, have accused tourists of damaging a statue of the country's first leader and his wife by fondling the woman's exposed breast . The sculpture, which has been in place for ten years, depicts Yu The Great, the founder of China's first Xia Dynasty in 2070 BC, meeting his wife . Legend says that Yu and his wife were brought together by a nine-tailed fox that lead them to one another . The bronze tells the story of how the leader met his wife, after the couple were supposedly brought together by a mythical nine-tailed fox. Over the decade that the statue has been in place, people have been touching the hand of Yu The Great, the fox's back, and wife's chest. While the rest of the statue is black, the colour of the coating applied to protect the metal, the parts that have been touched have worn away to expose the metal underneath. Over the years tourists have kept touching Yu's hand, the fox's back, and his wife's exposed breast - leading to them becoming worn . While the rest of the metallic sculpture is black, the colour of the protective layer which coats the statue, the fox, hand and breast have become worn, exposing the metal underneath . Locals accuse tourists of having a lack of respect for culture, but admit the behaviour is unlikey to change . Yu the Great is thought to have lived between 2,200–2,100 BCE, and is credited with uniting the nine early provinces of China. While little is known about his rule, as his predates the earliest written records by nearly a millennium, he is credited with building an immense system of flood defences in central China. These helped to bring prosperity and stability to the volatile region, and so impressed another emperor that he named Yu as his heir, rather than his own son.\n",

            "Australia's most notorious serial killer could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers, had the 'wrong man' not been sent to prison, a new investigation has claimed. Channel Seven's Sunday Night will tell the story of Ivan Milat's first violent crime and how he escaped police prosecution, before going on to butcher seven backpackers. The revelation includes first-hand evidence from Milat's older brother, Boris, into the killer's 'secret victim'. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Boris Milat shares a secret he has kept for 52 years, which details how Australia's bloodiest butcher was responsible for the shooting more than two decades before the first backpacker murder in 1989, according to the report. The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man, who Channel Seven has not yet named, tells Mr Milat, as they shake hands. According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 19-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Former Detective Paul Gordon tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible'. Boris Milat tells the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime told the killer's brother, Boris . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat’s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. According to claims made by the program, Milat would have been about 19 when he claimed his first victim . The daughter of Milat's first victim (left) is told her father was shot by the serial killer. Former Detective Paul Gordon (right) tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible' The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl’s stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . The evil killer has penned a series of rambling letters while behind bars, according to a book released by his eldest nephew, Alistair Shipsey. The Milat Letters, is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she’s 25, white. I ought to ask her “why” as she only knows me from a website, and there’s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Milat has been a troublesome inmate during his time in prison, and it is believed he planned at least one escape and swallowed metal objects in an attempt to get out of jail.

In prison, Milat, has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape, swallowing metal objects and cutting off his own finger to send to the High Court in an envelope . One of his letters revealed plans to cut off his own finger and mail it law enforcement. ‘I will send them parts of my hand first, I have been considering this for a while and only need half a reason to show them how I feel with their sh**head ideas, there is not much they can do to me any more and at my age I don't give a f**k,' an excerpt from his letters reads.

            "This is the terrifying moment that one wrong move sent a climber tumbling 10 metres down an icy cliff face. Karlis Bardelis, 30, from Latvia, was attempting to scale the cliff in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, when the accident happened. And footage from a camera mounted to his helmet shows the very second that his climbing axe came loose. Mr Berdalis said: 'I was just thinking \"I hope I land somewhere soft and don't break any bones\".' Scroll down for video . The footage shows climber Karlis Bardelis carefully traversing the ridge, left, but one wrong move sends him tumbling down the icy cliff face in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, right . You see his feet literally above his head as he continues to fall down the mountain head-first . Karlis Bardelis, left, and Gary Kinsey, right, on Headhunter's summit on January 28, 2012. Bardelis has only just released the footage of his terrifying fall on a training exercise in hospital . Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in the video below, you can see the axe slipping out of the ice and knocking his other axe out of position. Almost immediately his feet were in the air and Karlis can see nothing but his boots and the blue sky as he begins the terrifying fall down the 60m mountain. He continues to fall for three-and-a-half seconds until he's eventually saved by his safety rope after falling ten metres. But the experienced Latvian climber, who now works in Nepal, held his nerve after the tumble and even continued his ascent to the top. Bardelis scaling the mountain which he fell from. On the left you can see the safety rope that saved his life . Holding his nerve: The experienced climber grips the rock face on his ascent . He said: 'My ropes saved me and stopped my fall. 'These kind of falls are very dangerous because I'm carrying two ice tools and crampons, both of which are really sharp and could cause serious injuries. 'Obviously there's the risk of hitting a rock on my way down, which can cause serious fractures. 'I never think that I'm going to die in these situations - I never consider death as an option' Karlis had travelled to Scotland to take part in a training course organised by the British Mountaineering Council joining climbers from 26 countries. And he attempted the level six climb with some trepidation. Life on the line: Bardelis was rescued by his safety rope after his axe became dislodged from the ice, knocking the other out of position and sending him plunging down the mountain . He said: 'I was feeling excited about that climb but at the same time I was feeling scared in those difficult parts too. 'I fell because I made a mistake; I put one ice axe in a crack and was trying to put another one in but the placement wasn't good so it ripped the other one out. 'My crampons weren't in a stable place so I fell.' The footage shows Karlis tumble backwards from the cliff face and free fall towards the ground. Incredibly, after being saved by his harness, Karlis continued his ascent after the fall. He said: 'I climbed back to the same place and this time did it right using the same technique. 'Some people laugh when they see the video - others say they are not going to sleep after seeing it. 'I guess it was a good example of how not to climb.' Top class: The Latvian is an experience climber who now works in Nepal. When he began falling, all he could dow was hope that he landed somewhere soft and didn't break any bones, he said .\n",

            "Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .\n",

            "(CNN)Caught up in a rip current while snorkeling at Finn's Beach in Bali, Roxy Walsh was holding on to some rocks when she spotted something special. Engraved with the words, \"Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny,\" the antique ring lodged in the rocks clearly meant something to both Joe and Jenny. But there were no other clues (besides the fact that the words were written in English) as to where the couple might live. When she returned home to Palm Beach, Australia, Walsh was determined to reunite the ring with its owner. She went to the 5,000 members of her company's Facebook page, Kids in Adelaide, to reunite Joe and Jenny with the ring. She also created a \"Find Joe and Jenny\" page to track them down. \"Hi all. It's Roxy here. This is a reaaaallyy long shot but would love some SHARE love on this post to help find Joe. Found this gold ring snorkeling at Finns Beach in Bali today. It's got a family crest on it, and engraved with the message 'Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny' How amazing would it be to find him! Please click share.\" The post got shared all over the world. Nine months earlier, Joe Langley had been snorkeling in the same spot in Bali when he lost the ring, which his wife, Jenny, had purchased an antique store and had engraved for his birthday. \"I went for a swim, got caught in a rip, decided the rip was going to take me and finished up on the rocks,\" Langley told Sunshine Coast Daily. \"In clawing my way over the rocks, the ring pulled off my finger.\" The Langleys' 19-year-old granddaughter saw the Facebook post April 9 and made the connection. It turns out that the Langleys are fellow Australians, living in the town of Noosa, just three hours from where Walsh lives in Palm Beach. Walsh had the ring professionally cleaned before she met the happy Langleys in Noosa to return it.\n",

            "After Manchester United eased past Aston Villa to make it five Premier League wins on the bounce, Juan Mata admitted his side still have work to do and must take every game as a 'final.' The Spaniard has found his best form at a crucial part of the season, with a place in the Champions League all but sealed and an opportunity to finish second a real possibility. United are currently above rivals Manchester City by one point and looking for a top two finish - where they can qualify automatically for the group stages - but Mata knows his side can't afford to slip-up in the final seven games. Juan Mata (right) says Manchester United need to look at the next seven Premier League games as 'finals' The 26-year-old has been in fine form for Louis van Gaal's side during their five game winning run . 'The season has gone so quickly – it seems we were in pre-season only a few months ago. But we still have some finals left before the end,' he told MUTV. 'We want to finish as high as we can and I think we can win a lot of games between now and the end of the season if we perform like we did in the last few games. 'We are facing two or three very big rivals like Chelsea, City and Arsenal so we need to be at our best level to beat them. Each game is a final and we have to think about each one on their own.

            "Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between Nicola Sturgeon and the French ambassador. The SNP leader has denied telling French ambassador Sylvie Bermann that she would prefer David Cameron to remain in Number 10 while suggesting that Ed Miliband was not Prime Minister material. Ms Sturgeon told supporters at a rally in Glasgow today that she had written to Sir Jeremy to demand an official investigation. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, had asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate the leaked memo . She told supporters in Glasgow today that the Westminster establishment were afraid of the SNP's rise and called on Ed Miliband to commit to 'locking out' David Cameron from Downing Street next month . Ms Sturgeon completely denied claims that she secretly hoped David Cameron would win the election . She claimed that the story was a sign of 'panic' within the Westminster establishment over the surge of support for her party. She then called on Mr Miliband to publicly commit to working with the SNP to 'lock out' Mr Cameron from Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament. Ms Sturgeon described the account of her conversation with the French ambassador as '100 per cent untrue'. The memo was published in the Daily Telegraph was written by a British civil servant following a conversation with consul-general Pierre-Alain Coffinier regarding the meeting between Ms Sturgeon and ambassador Sylvie Bermann, who was on her first visit to Scotland in February. According to the memo: 'Discussion appears to have focused mainly on the political situation, with the FM stating that she wouldn't want a formal coalition with Labour; that the SNP would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she'd rather see David Cameron remain as PM.' The note went on to say that Ms Sturgeon had said she did not think Labour leader Ed Miliband was 'prime minister material'. The civil servant added: 'I have to admit that I'm not sure that the FM's tongue would be quite so loose on that kind of thing in a meeting like that, so it might well be a case of something being lost in translation'. Mr Coffinier - who was at the meeting - told Sky News that he had no recollection of Ms Sturgeon's alleged comments. He said: 'I do not know where this comes from, because it is certainly not in my report that anyone gave any preference.' David Cameron, pictured today, said any deal between Labour and the SNP would be a 'chaos alliance' A spokesman for the Ms Bermann said: 'While the Ambassador and First Minister, some time ago, discussed the political situation, Ms Sturgeon did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister.' Attending an anti-nuclear rally in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: \"This story has already been shown to be 100 per cent untrue - having been comprehensively rejected by both the French Ambassador and Consul General. 'The real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the UK Government - came to be written by a UK Government civil servant and then leaked to Tory-supporting newspapers at the start of a General Election campaign. 'It suggests a Whitehall system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked. And the Foreign Office now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document. Nicola Sturgeon would rather see David Cameron win the election because she does not see Ed Miliband as ‘prime minister material’, it was reported last night. A memo shows that the Scottish first minister told the French ambassador in February she would prefer to see Mr Cameron remain in Downing Street. The document, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP’s opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum. Written by a senior civil servant, the memo from February 26 states: ‘The first minister confessed that she’d rather see David Cameron remain as PM (and didn’t see Ed Miliband as PM material).’ She has denied the claims while last night Last night the French consul general told the Guardian that no such views were given by Miss Sturgeon, and 'absolutely no preference was expressed' on the outcome of the general election. 'I am therefore writing to the head of the UK civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives.' The SNP leader added: 'Anyone who knows anything about me knows I don't want to see a Conservative government. I'm campaigning to get the Tories out of Downing Street. We've made if very clear that we will lock David Cameron out of Downing Street - the only person who's not made that clear is Ed Miliband. 'We've said that if there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, then we will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground. I reissue my challenge to Ed Miliband today to say likewise.' Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'Who knows what the reality is there? I think the one thing that we do know is that the SNP seem to be doing very well in Scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way Ed Miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the SNP and that would mean chaos for Britain.' And a Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband still won't rule out a deal with the SNP because he knows he can't get into Number 10 without them - he's in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon has him on a leash. 'And we know what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'The First Minister might deny reports of her tete-a-tete with the French but we all know a Conservative-only government is the result of this election that the SNP want to see. A Tory PM governing alone in Downing Street and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home. 'Despite her fluffy, positive words about working with the rest of the UK we know what she really thinks. Her sole ambition is to break up the UK.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal . Ed Miliband, pictured, said he will not enter into any coalition with the SNP as he wants a majority . Mr Miliband described the leaked memo as a 'damning revelation' claiming the SNP were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public. He said: 'I'm very clear that there won't be a coalition with the SNP. That's not going to happen, As for how other parties will end up voting on a Labour Queen's Speech, that's a matter for them. I want a majority Labour government.' Mr Miliband refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on SNP support to prop up a minority government. He added: 'What I'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the SNP. As for other post-election possibilities, I'm not getting into that.' Prime Minister David Cameron joined the row while campaigning in Oxfordshire today. He said: 'There is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain - Labour - and the people who want to break up Britain - the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. 'That's what we have got to avoid, that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back.' He claimed Ms Sturgeon's disputed opinion of the Labour leader 'told us something that I said about four years ago - that Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister. I think we knew that already'.\n",

            "Set side by side it’s hard to believe they’re the same person. One with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair. The other, five decades on, pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair. These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Fredric Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High, Irvington, New Jersey. They were taken at the age of 18, when he was, in his own words, just ‘a Jewish kid from Newark,’ and before he had transformed himself, in every sense, into the figure lampooned on Netflix show ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,’ with such devastating consequences. Scroll down for video . The way he was: These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Frederic Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High in New Jersey . Dispirited: The famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. He had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Changes: Five decades after his high school photo with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair, Dr. Brandt was pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair . It is two days since the famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. The City of Miami Police confirmed the suicide after Daily Mail Online broke the news earlier, and, according to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show. Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt’s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school’s yearbook earned him a reputation for his ‘infectious grin’ and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.’ Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students. Among his many accolades listed are Assistant Editor of High School magazine the Morellian, President of the Spanish Club, Vice President of the Debate Club, Vice President of the Political Science Club and a place on the National Honors Society. He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student. But, for all that, in one of his last interviews, given to the New York Times in March 2014, he recalled feeling very much that he was ‘more of a different child,’ as he grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. He said: ‘I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios and other things. I was always questioning everything to see how it worked.’ In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth – he had hundreds of patients, saw as many as 30 daily with some paying as much as $7,000 a pop and had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store. Three years before he graduated and before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly. Loss: Three years before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly . Dr. Brandt was known for his ‘infectious grin’ and characterized by classmates as having a sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.' He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student . The awards and accolades followed him from this 1967 yearbook through his professional career . Speaking to the New York Times last March he admitted: ‘It was a lot to process, but you just have to forge ahead.’ He certainly did. Immediately after high school he attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He went on to graduate with his MD from Drexel University’s Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1975. Dermatology was not his first love though it would be the speciality on which he settled and which earned him a client list including Madonna, Kelly Ripa, Stephanie Seymour and a constellation of other entertainment big hitters. As a student he loved oncology, nephrology, hematology and cardiology. The one area of medicine in which the life-long bachelor took no real pleasure was pediatrics. He explained: ‘You spent all your time calming patients down.’ Between 1976 and 1978 he completed his internship at New York University Veterans Administration before going onto specialise in dermatology at the University of Miami, 1978–1981. He set up a private practice in Miami and it was only in 1998 that an invitation to use a colleague’s New York office once a month to treat patients with ever evolving newly introduced facial fillers led Dr Brandt to his ultimate area of expertise.

Hurtful parody: According to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Tina Fey takes a selfie with Maya Rudolph and  Martin Short last February. Poignantly, given his own unhappy demise, Dr Brandt’s ambition in his work had always been, he said, ‘to restore a face to harmony,’ and ‘to keep people working and feeling vital and good about themselves.’ He built an empire on his work. As well as seeing his private patients, he hosted a weekly call-in show on Sirius XM radio, ran a company manufacturing his own line of skin creams and serums and appeared regularly on the speaking circuit proselytizing on his speciality at international medical conferences. Over the years Dr Brandt practiced what he preached. He became best known for his Y lifts in which fillers are injected below the cheekbones. And he regularly injected himself with Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvedem and Voluma leading to his own startlingly changed appearance - converted into cruel and undeniable parody on ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ as Dr Franff. The good life: In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth. He had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store . Played by Martin Short Franff’s transformation is so grotesque that he can barely utter certain words – including his own name. He is actually called Grant, rendering the veil of fiction between the character and Brandt even more gossamer thin. At one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched. For Dr Brandt, who had always prided himself on being ‘a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be,’ the humor, viewed through the prism of his depression, cut deep. There have been many tributes since his death Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, yesterday tweeted, ‘Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.’ Morning show host, Kelly Ripa, posted: ‘My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr Frederic Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer.’\n",

            "Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club . Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match . The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February . Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago . The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time . 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club . The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining . 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause. 'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.' Redknapp  lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer . People are being urged to search Men United and do something great with their mates via prostatecanceruk.org/menunited. Tickets for the Men United XI match are priced at £10 adults and £5 concessions, and are available from www.lofcdirect.co.uk.\n",

            "German air traffic control officials today called for technology that ground staff could use in an emergency to take remote command of a plane. Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month. Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. Disaster: Rescue workers and debris from the Germanwings jet at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France . Call: Klaus-Dieter Scheurle (above), head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month . Mr Scheurle said in Frankfurt: ‘Such an event might cause us to reconsider systems which would allow the control of aircraft to be taken over by personnel on the ground in emergency situations.’ He added that it was important to ‘think past today's technology’, explaining that such a system could be used in an emergency on the ground to take remote control of a plane and safely land it. Mr Scheurle said that it was not the ‘simplest solution’, adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets. Pilots associations are sceptical of the plans, with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse. In charge: Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately flew the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board . Tribute: Flowers in front of the monument in homage to the victims of the Germanwings flight in Le Vernet . A spokesman said: ‘We also have to ask whether such a solution would really be an improvement. After all, it's the pilots who are sitting in the cockpit and they're the ones with all the information.’ The British Airline Pilots' Association also urged caution. ‘We must act with careful consideration to ensure new safety risks or concerns are not created, such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft,’ a spokesman said. Since the Germanwings crash, European airlines have implemented a rule that two people must be in the cockpit at all times and Germany has set up a task force with the aviation industry to consider changes to medical and psychological tests for pilots. Commercial planes could be hacked in flight by passengers using the in-flight entertainment system to access flight controls, a US watchdog agency warned last night. Cyber-security experts said onboard firewalls intended to protect aircraft electronics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers. A 'virus or malware’ planted on websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attack, one expert told Government Accountability Office investigators. A GAO report identified the hacking risk as one of several emerging weaknesses that the Federal Aviation Administration must address as air traffic control systems advance in technology. The publication said: ‘Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.’ FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the aviation regulator has begun working with US government security experts including the National Security Agency to identify needed changes. ‘This threat will continue to evolve and it is something that needs to be at the forefront of our thinking,’ he told a Senate oversight panel. Politicians in Congress called on the FAA to act.\n",

            "From the best night's kip being enjoyed on a Wednesday to rising the earliest on a Sunday, new data is giving fascinating insights into how the world sleeps. Using statistics from Sleep Cycle app users, researchers have discovered that the earliest wake-up time worldwide is on a Monday in South Africa. While on Tuesdays, Americans rise at 7am and are in the worst mood all week. In terms of national average sleep quality, Slovakia topped the list.  The UK was in 45th place, while the US was in 49th. The best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. More than half (58 per cent) of countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day . Other countries that wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil. The Sleep Cycle app tracks a user's sleep as they go through a cycle of sleep phases. It uses the phone's accelerometer to identify phases by tracking movements in bed and wakes users up during their lightest sleep phase, using a pre-defined 30-minute alarm window. It has more than two million active users and gathered data for the study between 1 June 2014 and 31 March this year from users aged 18 to 55 in 47 countries. Other insights from this data include that the best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. Over the course of the week, people in Finland get the most hours sleep - on a Saturday with eight hours and two minutes, on average. On the same night, people in Japan get an average of just six hours and nine minutes sleep. This graph shows which days of the week countries sleep the most . More than half (58 per cent) of the countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. On Thursdays, people in the Middle East wake the latest and the happiest, and in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE in particular, users also reported the best mood on Thursdays. Despite waking up grumpy on Tuesdays, by Friday the US sleeps in the most and wakes up happiest. The data revealed Americans typically don't rise until 8:24am on Fridays and also report the best wake-up mood. MONDAY: The world wakes up earliest on Mondays with South Africa rising first at 6:09 am . TUESDAY: Americans rise early at 7am and are consequently in the worst mood all week. Other countries that also wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil . WEDNESDAY: 58% of countries surveyed - including the US - experience sleep best on Wednesdays, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. THURSDAY: Middle East users sleep longer on Thursdays than any other day, and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE also report the best mood on Thursdays. FRIDAY: Americans sleep latest on Fridays, not rising until 8:24am. They also report the best wake-up mood. People in Costa Rica, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden also wake up the happiest on Friday. However, the majority of the world (71 per cent), wake up in the best mood on Saturdays. SATURDAY: Nearly 90% of countries surveyed sleep more and wake up later on Saturday compared to any other day of the week. SUNDAY:The majority of the world (66% of countries) spends the least amount of time in bed on Sundays. Topping the list is South Korea where users only sleep 5 hours and 53 minutes on Sunday nights. Also waking up happier on Fridays are people in Costa Rica, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden. However, the majority of the world (71 per cent) wakes up in the best mood on Saturdays. Nearly 90 per cent of countries surveyed sleep more and wake up later on Saturday compared to any other day of the week.

            "It looks like your typical outback fibro home, tin roof and all, but this property which is currently for sale is now at the centre of one of Australia's most chilling murder mysteries. For days now, detectives have swarmed over three bedroom Leeton home where Stephanie Scott's accused killer, high school cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, lived with his mother Anika and elder brother Luke. In a rare scene of frantic activity on this peaceful suburban street, home to families and pensioners, investigators clad in blue forensic overalls heaped bags of evidence out the back of the property on Thursday evening. Detectives had first arrived at the property on Wednesday night speaking to two occupants before Mr Stanford arrived home and charged after investigators discovered discrepancies in his alibi. Police allege they discovered blood inside the school cleaner's Toyota Hilux, a picture of a burnt body on his mobile phone and a set of school keys thought to belong to Ms Scott inside the property itself. Neighbours told Daily Mail Australia the Stanford family have lived at the property, which is on the market for $179,000, for 'around 13 months'. Gail Scanlan, who lives next-door, said they would regularly chat to the 'beautifully manner' but quiet Mr Stanford over the backyard fence. Scroll down for video . This Leeton property looks like your typical outback home, tin roof and all, and now this property is now at the centre of the Stephanie Scott murder investigation . The back door of the Stanford family home was left permanently ajar as investigators swarmed the property in a quiet Leeton street on Thursday . Investigators lumped various items of interest next to a van in the fibro property's backyard . Clad in blue Forensic Services overalls, detectives were pictured hauling large bags containing items of interest into a waiting police vehicle . One of the recycling bins out the back of the home was pictured toppled over as police swarmed the property on Thursday evening . On Monday evening - the night after the alleged murder - neighbours said Stanford told them he had waved and said he had been 'busy' as he hung out his washing on their Hills Hoist, Fairfax Media reported. Daily Mail Australia understands the family have been renting the property, which was constructed in 1960. An advertisement published on the Domain property website touted the positive features of purchasing the three-bedroom home, targeted at potential buyers looking to escape the rental market. 'Why burn your money? Rent money is dead money & for just a small deposit & repayments close to your monthly rent we can move you into this Maiden Avenue home without a fuss. 'Boasting three bedrooms, separate lounge, dining & TV room plus evaporative air conditioning & two wood heaters this home is sure to please. Inspection anytime.'

A large fireplace is the most prominent feature of the TV room, with the floor covered in drab gray carpeting lining up to wooden floorboards in the property's kitchen. An aged lime-green counter sits atop wooden cupboards and a simple stove where the Stanford family would whip up breakfast and dinner. The backyard is spacious and stretches back to a long, tin fence, over which the Stanfords often make small-talk with their neighbours and relax in the sunshine. One of their bins was pictured toppled over on Thursday, as police continued their investigations behind a thick white-and-blue line of police tape.

            "If it feels as though summer has come early, that’s because we’re already enjoying August temperatures. This week’s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern England is to continue – and warm up. The temperature in the South is forecast to reach 24C (75F) today and 25C (77F) tomorrow, surpassing the highest seen so far this year, the 21.9C (71.4F) recorded in London on Friday. The delightful weather, caused by warm air blowing up from the Azores, is creating conditions we might usually experience in July or August. Scroll down for video .

Unusual sight: A man appears to walk across a rainbow at the beach at Barry Island, near Cardiff in south Wales yesterday . Stunning: A fog bank rolling onto Portsmouth from the Solent, after cool air moved quickly over the surface of the warm water . Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever. There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather, and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F (37.8C) this year. Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C (64F) average daytime temperature in August, and way ahead of the 11C (52F) normally expected in April. This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow, but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night: ‘We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. ‘On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C (73F to 77F) in prolonged sunshine. That is double the daytime average for this time of year. ‘Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places. Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens. Wednesday warmth: Most of England and Wales will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting 24C later this week . Peak District awakening: The morning mist looking out across the Derbyshire village of Foolow, near Grindleford, which woke to a frost . Going for a walk: A deer in the morning mist near Foolow in Derbyshire yesterday, as Britons prepared for the warmest weather of the year so far . ‘There is a cold air mass arriving on Thursday night but it is expected to stay dry well into next week. After that we can be less certain.’ The spell of warm weather, which has now lasted more than a week, has seen people flocking to the nation’s beaches. Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters. Barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to six feet long, were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon. The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean, but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The species is harmless to humans, but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood, whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking, said: ‘No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’ After the bad smog seen late last week in the South-East, the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days.

Over the water: Sunrise near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside, as Britain basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far . But pollution levels will increase again on Thursday and Friday, particularly in the South-West, where Cornwall and Devon are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels. The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. ‘We’re still in the midst of spring, so it’s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.’ Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday: ‘The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise. ‘This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming.’ And Nicola McGeady from Coral added: 'The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting.' Hot day: These graphics show the cloud coverage and temperatures tomorrow, with the South East expected to have the best weather . Arriving: The predicted hot weather this week is the result of a plume of warm air heading towards the UK from the south west . Green for cold, red for hot: These graphics from Netweather show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow (left) and Wednesday (right) A third of weather bets to Ladbrokes have come from punters in the South East - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week. And the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been £1,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in January. Meanwhile, Coral - MailOnline's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer. The Met Office has confirmed that hotter-than-average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below-average conditions until June. It said in a long-range forecast that ‘much of the tropical Pacific Ocean remains warmer than average and close to El Nino thresholds’. El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America. The Met Office says most climate models ‘now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer’. With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week, thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach. But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013. The act, known as ‘tombstoning’, can lead to people suffering ‘cold water shock’ when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said: ‘Rivers, lakes and canals may look inviting, especially on a hot day and after a drink. ‘But it’s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse, kill you.’ On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week, firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013. Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood’s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. But the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant more plankton is available - and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Floating: The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way . The Red Cross says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth. Vinegar is said to be far more effective. Vet Mr Kirkwood said: ‘No doubt they [are] encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. ‘I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’\n",

            "Things haven't been going well for Manchester United flop Anderson since he left Old Trafford to return to Brazil, but at least on Wednesday his own errors were outshone by the stupidity of a team-mate. The Brazilian midfielder was sent off for Internacional after a first-half off-the-ball shove on Ypiranga Erechim striker Otacilio Neto that also saw his opponent sent off for retaliating with an elbow. But fortunately for Anderson, his colleague Fabricio stole the limelight by swearing at his own fans and becoming the third player to be shown the red card, reducing Internacional to nine men in the 1-1 draw in Porto Alegre. Former Manchester United midfielder Anderson shoved Otacilio Neto off the ball to earn a red card . Neto also saw red after he retaliated by by appearing to aim an elbow at Anderson in Porto Alegre . The two players listen to the referee as he reaches for his card from his back pocket on Wednesday night . Anderson shows his shock to be shown the red card for what he believed to be an innocent challenge . While some players offered their hands in apology to the fans after being repeatedly booed, Fabricio took a different route and showed two middle fingers to the crowd leaving referee Luis Teixeira Rocha with no choice but to give him his marching orders. The 28-year-old left back reacted by tearing off his shirt, throwing it to the floor and shouting 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving,' as he walked down the tunnel. He has already been suspended until the end of the week by his club. Anderson ended his seven-and-a-half year association with United in February by signing a four-year deal with Internacional, but his return to Brazil has not gone as planned. Internacional's Fabricio was also sent off later in the game for aiming his middle fingers at booing fans . Fabricio threw his shirt to the ground after being shown the red card and shouted 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving' Having missed a penalty on his debut, he was substituted later in February after just 36 minutes needing oxygen while playing in the high-altitude Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz. While Internacional sit top of the table in the Campeonato Gaucho, Anderson has faced a familiar struggle for fitness despite making eight appearances since his move. Anderson ended a miserable seven-and-a-half year spell with Manchester United by leaving this season .\n",

            "Accused: Officer Aaron Stringer, from Bakersfield, California, allegedly pulled on the toes and 'tickled' the feet of a man whom police had recently killed . A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own. Shooting: Above shows local news footage of the scene where Villegas was shot. He had just crashed his car after a chase .\n",

            "A senior writer for the Australian Financial Review has labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs', while standing up for an SBS football reporter  who was sacked after condemning Anzac day on Twitter. SBS journalist Scott McIntyre was fired on Sunday over his tweets which called Anzac day 'the cultification of an imperialist invasion' and accused Australian Diggers of committing war crimes which included 'widespread rape and theft.' Speaking up in support of him, the AFR's Geoff Winestock wrote on the social media site: 'Ridiculous. Frightening. I also think Anzacs were racist yobs and Anzac Day is a death cult. Sack me Fairfax.' On Friday, the day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said of the memorial: 'Anzac Day wish: in next 30 years there will be no wars and in 50 years no soldiers around to honour.' Scroll down for video . Australian Financial Review journalist Geoff Winestock (left) has spoken out in support of sacked SBS journalist Scott McIntyre (right), who was fired on Sunday over his controversial Anzac day tweets . The senior writer for the Australian Financial Review labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs' The day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said he hoped 'in 50 years no soldiers around to honour' Both Fairfax and Mr Winestock declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments,  SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre’s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre’s position at SBS, with immediate effect.' McIntyre's comments sparked outrage late on Anzac day, with Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball calling them 'despicable remarks' and social media users taking to twitter to spread the #sackScottMcIntre hashtag. In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey . 'We remember and commemorate our ANZACs': SBS Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, saying they are 'not at all the views of @SBS' 'The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society,' McIntyre tweeted, referring to the Anzac's landing on Turkey's Gallipoli peninsula. In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted. 'Wonder if the poorly-read, largely white, nationalist drinkers and gamblers pause today to consider the horror that all mankind suffered. Mr McIntyre has more than 30,000 Twitter followers. The SBS journalist accused the Australian diggers of committing war crimes . McIntyre condemned the commemoration of Anzac Day and mocked the Digger's bravery . McIntyre's comments referred to the soldiers as 'terrorists' and were met with disgust by Twitter users . McIntyre's comments came on the 100th anniversary of the tragic Battle of Gallipoli (members of the public seen streaming into the Australian War Memorial, right, and names of fallen soldiers, left) Mr Turnbull also chimed into the discussion, calling the comments 'offensive' SBS's managing director Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the national broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, after incensed social media users launched a Twitter tirade calling for the company to fire the reporter. 'Comments from @mcintinhos are his own, disrespectful and not at all the views of @SBS. We remember and commemorate our ANZACs,' Mr Ebeid wrote on Twitter. The offensive tweets were still live on McIntyre's Twitter feed the day after they were published, prompting angry social media users to accuse SBS of being 'complicit' and labelling Mr Ebeid's tweet a 'token apology.' SBS's managing director Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the media company . Angry social media users accused SBS of being 'complicit' Others accused SBS Managing Director Mr Ebeid's of making a 'token apology' last night . Social media users claimed that the tweets were offensive and 'un-Australian' especially on Anzac Day . SBS has since responded with an official apology for offence caused, stating 'respect for Australian audiences is paramount at SBS.' 'At SBS, employees on and off air are encouraged to participate in social media, however maintaining the integrity of the network and audience trust is vital,' Mr Ebeid and Mr Shipp said in the today's statement. 'It is unfortunate that on this very important occasion, Mr McIntyre’s comments have compromised both. 'SBS apologises for any offence or harm caused by Mr McIntyre’s comments which in no way reflect the views of the network. SBS supports our Anzacs and has devoted unprecedented resources to coverage of the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.' Flag bearers stand to attention during the 100th anniversary service of ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Galllipoli, an event the Australian sports reporter has called 'an imperialist invasion' Twitter users labelled McIntyre's comments an 'Un-australian anti Anzac disgrace!' Disgusted social media users began circulating the hashtag #sackScottMcIntyre. Twitter user Brian Cox wrote: '#sackScottMcIntyre SBS sack this dirty traitor! Un-australian anti Anzac disgrace! Calling Anzac's war criminals on this sacred day!' 'Come on SBS this disrespectful little grub needs to go #sackScottMcIntyre,' Jimmy Nuciforo added. 'The ANZACS died defending what this idiot is abusing - free speech,' tweeted another social media user. The hashtag #sackScottMcIntyre began trending on Twitter after social media users saw his comments . McIntyre's comments were labelled offensive, especially in light of the centenary of Gallipoli . Some Twitter users defended his right to free speech, and said that if Mr McIntyre was fired for 'speaking the truth' that was compromising his right to express himself. Others took offense to the fact the comments were coming from someone employed with taxpayer funds. 'He should lose his taxpayer funded job,' said one Twitter user, while another said, 'Not normally my thing, but since I am paying for it .... #sackScottMcIntyre'.\n",

            "(CNN)Saturday at the Masters, like any PGA tournament, has been dubbed 'Moving Day'. It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. \"It could have been a super low today,\" a disappointed Woods said after his round. \"All in all. It should have been two shots better.\" Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible . The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. \"It really is,\" he said. \"We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions.\" He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.\n",

            "Greater Manchester Police tweeted a warning about wasting time after a holidaymaker walked into a station to complain about his trip. The 44-year-old from Oldham decided had just returned from Algeria and wanted to complain about the temperatures he experienced during his holiday. Police tweeted the anecdote after the man tried to lodge an official complaint at the Great Manchester Police Chadderton division. Great Manchester Police Chadderton division revealed a man lodged a complaint that the weather on his holiday was 'too hot' The incident was shared by the police press office on its Facebook page, along with a warning that members of the public should not waste police time. There was a warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline Travel: 'The male was advised that this was not a police problem.' Following the post being shared on Facebook, there were mixed reactions to the man's actions. Janine Gamblen wrote: 'Some people really are just stupid,' while Sarah Edwards added: 'Only in Oldham.' The 44-year-old man had recently returned to the UK from a holiday in Algeria (file photo) 'The mind boggles,' commented Tracy Ayre while Suzi Force believes the man should have been punished, saying: 'Give him a holiday in a cell, maybe he will think twice next time!' However, Joanne Parker made light of the incident writing: 'Haha funny...would love to have seen the police face.' The current temperatures in Algeria is 28C, and this has remained fairly constant over the last week or two. Temperatures are set to peak at 25C over the next three days in England, however the north will see slightly lower temperatures than the south. It's not known if the Oldham man travelled to the Sahara Desert in Algeria, where he would undoubtedly have been 'hot'\n",

            "A heartbroken pensioner is believed to have killed himself six days after his wife's death by jumping from a bridge at their 'special place' where they used to take romantic walks together. John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain. His family feared the worst after discovering a note describing how much he missed his wife of 63 years and how he could not live without her. Double tragedy: John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, pictured together on their wedding anniversary, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain . Nottinghamshire Police launched an appeal in a bid to track down the grandfather-of-three on the day he disappeared from his home in St Ann's, Nottingham. Today officers confirmed a body pulled from the River Trent on April 15 by a specialist underwater search unit was sadly that of the missing pensioner. His family believe he may have killed himself at the picturesque beauty spot where the devoted couple enjoyed going for a walk. Message: Mr Lord's daughter Alison said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all' and described how he could not live without his wife . Mr Lord's last known moments were also captured on CCTV as he parked his white Toyota Yaris car near close to the Trent at 3.15am on April 6. The footage then shows the pensioner walking toward a bridge, which was the last sighting of him. His daughter, Alison Lord, 56, said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all.' Speaking before his death, the teaching assistant, who lives in Bulwell, Nottingham, added: 'He did leave a note. 'It said he couldn't live without June, and he apologised and said \"love to all\". 'It was completely out of character for him to get up and drive his car in the middle of the night.' Ms Lord said her parents, who were members of a local church, had been 'inseparable' and her mum's death had left the whole family devastated. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: 'The body of a man found in the River Trent on April 15, 2015, has been confirmed as that of missing John Lord. 'Mr Lord, 86, went missing from his home in St Ann's on Monday, 6 April. 'His body was recovered at around 11am on April 15 by Nottinghamshire Police's Underwater Search Unit. 'Nottinghamshire Police would like to thank everyone who assisted in the search for Mr Lord by sharing our appeals. 'Mr Lord's family will continue to be supported and have asked for their privacy to be respected. 'The thoughts of Nottinghamshire Police are with the family at this difficult time.' June tragically died on March 31, eight hours after collapsing suddenly from what doctors at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham described as a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain.

            "Manuel Pellegrini has admitted he is disappointed in Yaya Toure but vowed to back the Manchester City midfielder — at least until the end of the season. Sportsmail revealed City would listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to overhaul an ageing squad at the end of a faltering campaign. Toure is determined not to be forced out but the Chilean, speaking ahead of Sunday's visit of West Ham, acknowledged the midfielder had underperformed and dismissed claims he should be given a rest. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has come in for criticism for his performances this season . Manuel Pellegrini has admitted he has been disappointed by the Ivory Coast midfielder's level . ‘I don’t think he’s happy with his performance this year — and nor am I,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He doesn’t need a break.’ Toure, who has two years left on a £220,000-a-week deal, has come in for criticism amid the collapse of City’s Premier League defence. But Pellegrini, who faces questions over his own future, said the 31-year-old would be backed. ‘He’s a very important player and he will have my support until the end of the season,’ he said. City, who have taken just 18 points from the last available 39, take on Sam Allardyce’s side knowing that defeat will leave fifth-placed Liverpool with the chance to close the gap to one point with victory at West Brom next weekend. City will also face the Hammers without captain Vincent Kompany, who could miss the rest of the campaign with a muscle injury. With his manager in the firing line, City goalkeeper Joe Hart insisted the players should take responsibility. ‘People have been disappointed in their own performances,’ said the England No 1. ‘We’ve let the manager down a few times and we’ve baffled ourselves because we feel like we’ve got the quality to beat anyone and that’s not been the case.’ City boss Pellegrini has vowed to support Toure until at least the end of the season . Sportsmail revealed that Manchester City will listen to offers for Toure in the summer . Hart added that Pellegrini retained the backing of the dressing room. ‘He’s been great,’ Hart said. ‘He’s hard, he kind of says it how it is and you can’t ask for much more than that from a manager.’ Pellegrini, however, said: ‘The players have responsibility but I choose the players.’ Meanwhile Sam Allardyce has warned Aaron Cresswell not to make the same mistake as others amid interest from Chelsea and Manchester City. Manchester City want to sign West Ham left back Aaron Cresswell in the summer . Sam Allardyce has warned Cresswell not to make same mistake as other English players by moving to City . Allardyce believes the 25-year-old is an attractive prospect after a fine season at West Ham and because he can help clubs fill homegrown player quotas. ‘Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair spent time at City but did not play a great deal,’ Allardyce wrote in his Evening Standard column. ‘The decision for a player like Sinclair is would he be willing to join another club in a permanent deal if it meant less money?’\n",

            "Catania, Italy (CNN)The boat that sank in the Mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid, a U.N. official said. Carlotta Asami, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' refugee agency, made the comments to CNN early Tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in Catania, Italy. \"They say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that, you know, a big ship creating a big wave -- they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance,\" Asami said. The account she offered differs from that provided by Italian authorities on Sunday. They said that as the cargo ship King Jacob approached late Saturday, migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side, hoping to be saved, and caused the vessel to capsize. Mark Clark -- a communications executive representing OSM Maritime Group, the company that manages the King Jacob -- denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize. He said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side, causing many to fall off. The cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached, hardly making any waves, Clark told CNN. It deployed rescue boats, a gangway, nets and life rings, he said. The conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the Mediterranean. Asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were \"consistent\" in what they were saying. She said their accounts made it \"credible to think\" that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya. Previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950. Italian authorities, who have been coordinating the rescue effort, say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered. The King Jacob, whose crew members are all from the Philippines, saved 22 of the survivors, according to Clark. The cause of the shipwreck is part of Italian authorities' investigation, said Giovanni Salvi, Catania's public prosecutor. Investigators want to study the King Jacob's voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat, he told a news conference Monday. The likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa. Many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat. Asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat, while many people were down in the lowest area. Italian authorities said Sunday that an unidentified Bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily on Monday, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. They were the boat's Tunisian captain and a Syrian crew member, said Salvi, the Catania prosecutor. Italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to Catania, Salvi said, according to Italian media. The sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean to which European governments are struggling to respond. Vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue. The number of deaths has also skyrocketed. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between Libya and Italy just in the past week. It reported Monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters. Shipping companies recently warned that European governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble. \"We believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues, with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time,\" the European Community Shipowners Associations said in a letter to EU leaders last month. \"Commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues, which also create serious risks to the safety, health and welfare of ships' crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations,\" the letter said. Commercial ships rescued more than 40,000 people in the Mediterranean last year, according to the International Organization for Migration. That's higher than the more than 35,000 people saved by the Italian Coast Guard but lower than the 80,000 rescued by the Italian Navy, which was running a special program, Mare Nostrum, for most of the year. European Union ministers met Monday in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" said Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security police. Mogherini told CNN that the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" But some groups said European officials were offering too little too late. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" said Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save The Children. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss,\" Forsyth said in a statement. \"Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Catania, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

            "A bloodstained document revealing a life-or-death episode that could have derailed the whole US space programme of the 1960s is tipped to sell for £80,000 ($120,000). The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge £80,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), before having to come back in, which he said was 'the saddest moment of my life'. But the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when White was back inside. It's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside. Had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves, they wouldn't have been able to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and would have been lost in space. And had that worse case scenario happened, it could easily have scuppered the Apollo missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969. Edward White, pictured, became the first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 June 1965. He spent 20 minutes in space, and said coming back in was 'the saddest moment of my life'. As it was the first spacewalk, there were a number of complications. White used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space . The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. Shown is the first page of the checklist (left) and the Suit Integrity Check (right) for the spacecraft . The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. On the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft, and on the right, part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . Checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts. The spacewalk checklist for the Gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to McDivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago. The document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission. Cassandra Hatton, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the item, said: 'The Gemini 4 mission was the first time [an American] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme. Gemini 4 (pictured) launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board . Shown are astronauts Edward H. White II (left) and James A. McDivitt, command pilot for Gemini 4 . 'We knew we could get into space but until this point we didn't know if we could walk and float around out there. Jim McDivitt and Ed White's achievement is second only to landing on the moon. 'The checklist was vital for making sure things didn't go wrong and they didn't get sucked out into space. 'They had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck. There was a problem with the latch on the hatch. It was a really scary, life or death moment. 'If they hadn't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space. It would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme.' The auction takes place on April 24 in New York. The Gemini spacecraft (illustrated) was fairly cramped, leaving the astronauts little room to move around . This fantastic shot shows White floating above the curvature of Earth with the hatch seen open on the right .\n",

            "Chelsea match-winner Cesc Fabregas hailed a vital win after his late goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over QPR at Loftus Road. The game looked to be heading for a stalemate before Fabregas' 88th minute shot - their first on target in the game - found its way past Rob Green. The win moved Jose Mourinho's men seven points clear at the top of the table and Fabregas admitted it was an important goal. Midfielder Cesc Fabregas runs away in celebration having scored a vital winner in the 88th minute . 'It was vital. We know that we are playing for the most important trophy of the season,' the midfielder told Sky Sports. 'We're there in first place and we want to continue that.' He also paid tribute to the performance of QPR, saying: 'They were very difficult to play but we showed great mentality and never gave up in the difficult moments.' Cesc Fabregas wore a  protective mask during Chelsea's clash with QPR after breaking his nose last week . Cesc Fabregas' low strike, Chelsea's first shot on target, was enough to secure the win at Loftus Road . Chelsea striker Didier Drogba struggled to impose his game on a resolute QPR defence on Sunday . Blues striker Dider Drogba added: 'We had belief. We always play until the end. It was a tough game but the good thing with this team is we always play to the end.' Mourinho knew the win moved his side one step closer to a fifth league title, despite them having to work hard for it. 'Our situation was very positive. One point would be one less point we need, but the reality is that three points is always three points and one less match we need to win so is a very important step in a very important match,' he said. Nemanja Matic hugs his goalscoring team-mate Fabregas after the final whistle at Loftus Road . 'It was a very difficult match where the best quality was to control the game very well and stop our opponents scoring. 'They are a team that can score goals and have dangerous, attacking players so our best quality in the game was to keep calm and try to play against a team that was very well organised defensively and did a fantastic job,' added Mourinho. 'After that you have lots of times in the season when you win points or lose points in the end of the game, and we won two points in the last two minutes.' During the Chelsea celebrations at Loftus Road, the Blues were targeted by objects thrown from the crowd . Drogba celebrates the vital victory with team-mates John Terry (centre) and Branislav Ivanovic (right)\n",

            "The brave man who stood up against a neo-Nazi at an anti-Islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera. During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend, anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear. Mr King, from Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at Federation Square. Anti-racism protester Jacob King, from Melbourne, had a face off with a neo-Nazi at the Easter weekend's Reclaim Australia rallies . Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the Victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions . The anti-racism protester said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views' 'A few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines,' he said. 'I remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred, which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion. 'I have however felt this kind of anger before, and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him. 'I placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters. My arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face I was expecting him to attack me. But he didn't. 'As he began to relax I told him there would be no more fighting today. I wasn't expecting him to comply so easily, but I respect him for doing so.' Mr King said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of Melbourne, where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of 'racial prejudice and bigoted views'. 'I learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational,' he said. 'I have learned that the vast majority of Australian Muslims have come to Australia to improve their lives, contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding. Mr King said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . 'I attended the anti-racism rally because I recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of Muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government. 'I firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all Australians.' Numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation, but the most striking picture was taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe who captured Mr King during the Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . The identification of Jacob King comes after a Federal Government MP reported a group 'socialist ratbags' who were seen burning the Australian flag at the rally to the Human Rights Commission. The trio were at a Reclaim Australia demonstration, the same rally where Mr King was photographed. George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' who burnt the flag while protesting against the Reclaim Australia group. 'I have asked the Racial Discrimination Commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act,' Mr Christensen said. 'According to the Act, it is unlawful to perform any action in public that is likely to offend people of a particular race, religion, or national background. If sections of the Act can be applied to one race or nationality it must apply to all, whether a minority or the majority,' he also wrote. The rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across Australia on the Easter long weekend, organised by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia.

George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland (left) revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' (right) In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn't engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports.

            "A man strangled his friend to death in a rage after the friend admitted that he had been molesting young girls and thought 'one of them was starting to like it,' a jury heard this week. Robert Mccombs told a court in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Wednesday that Steven Carl Day admitted to him and his roommate Roger Musick that he molested a young relative and that he was molesting other young girls. 'Day said he thought one of the girls was starting to like it,' Mccombs testified. Witnessed the confession: Robert Mccombs (left) said that when Steven Carl Day admitted to him and his roommate Roger Musick (right) that he was a child molester, Musick strangled him to death . Shocking revelation: Steven Carl Day was allegedly murdered on December 18, 2013 after he told two friends that he molested young girls and that he thought, 'one of them was starting to like it' Day met up with Musick and Mccombs at a bar on December 18 to have drinks for Mccombs' birthday and that's where the shocking confession allegedly took place. 'My jaw just dropped that he would just admit it, blurt it out like that. I looked over at Roger and he was just as shocked as I was.' Musick, 39, mouthed the words 'I want to kill him,' Mccombs told the court. Mccombs told the court that the next thing he knew, Mccombs was attacking Day. Mccombs describes seeing Musick holding Day in a choke hold on the floor. 'When I saw him in the choke-hold, his arms were down, his eyes were bulging. He wasn't moving,' Mccombs told the court. The Detroit Free Press reports that the roommates put Day's dead body into the back of Mccombs' van and headed north where they found a ridge to drop the body. Addiction: After the murder in 2013, friends of Day said he was an Army veteran who had struggled in recent years while battling an alcohol addiction . Mccombs said that the two had breakfast before parting ways. Musick went to work and Mccombs went to their home to get rid of Day's belongings. He claims that he put Day's backpack and coat in a trash can at a nearby shopping center and then rode Day's bike to an abandoned car wash near the home. When detectives found Day's hat and cell phone in Mccomb's van, both he and Musick were charged with murder. Days later the charges were dropped but they were both later arrested and charged with tampering with evidence. Open container: This mug shot of Steven Carl Day, who described by friends as an alcoholic, was taken in 2011 after he was charged with consuming alcohol in public . Mccomb's was released from jail in Early March after more than a year behind bars for the 'tampering with evidence' charge. Musick was also about to be released but police later found there was enough evidence to charge him with Day's murder. Musick was returned to the Kent County Jail without bond. Kent County Sheriff's Detective Martin Albert said he found evidence at Day's home after the 2013 murder that suggested he he had admitted to molesting a five-year-old relative, 35 years ago. At the time of his death, Day had never been charged or prosecuted for any molestation crime. Though, Day was taking part in the Salvation Army's 12-step 'Turning Point' program during which Day confessed in a letter to the molestation. The program is intended to help participants confront their demons, particularly with addictions. Detective Albert testified after the murder that Day's sister was helping with the murder investigation and  told him her brother had admitted the molestation of a five-year-old relative about 35 years ago. A detective who analyzed the cell phones of both Mr Musick and Mr McCombs told Michigan's M LIve text messages had been sent between the two the day the body was found. McCombs allegedly wrote: 'You OK? The world is a better place today and one little girl can sleep tonight because her monster is gone.' Musick allegedly replied: 'True'.\n",

            "Reports of Cristiano Ronaldo's decline have been greatly exaggerated: The Real Madrid forward scored five goals against Granada, taking his tally in La Liga to 36 for the season - more than half of Europe's top teams. Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 at the Bernabeu, and their Portuguese talisman managed the first five-goal haul of his career. His record of 36 league goals for the season overtook Lionel Messi's 32 strikes, and put him in the incredible position of having scored more goals than 53 of the 98 teams in Europe's top five leagues this season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored an incredible five goals against Granada to lift his tally for the season to 36 . Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 . The Portuguese star now has more goals than 53 teams in Europe's top leagues, including nine in England . There are nine teams in the Barclays Premier League who have managed fewer goals in the league than Cristiano Ronaldo has this season. They are: . Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City. Ronaldo took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for Real, but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games, the sort of record most strikers can only dream of. And his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Newcastle United, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Torino and Lille. The first three of his five goals against Granada marked the quickest hat-trick of his career, coming in just eight first half minutes. Another followed 16 minutes later, and his last came 35 minutes after that. Ronaldo's displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Lille . It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he spoke of his delight afterwards . Lionel Messi and Barcelona came out on top in El Clasico but he has fewer league goals than Ronaldo . Borussia Dortmund, who can boast Marco Reus among their ranks, have fewer goals than the Real talisman . While Ronaldo overtook Messi on the goalscoring charts, the hat-trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the Argentine's record of 24 La Liga trebles. He almost matched Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano's 28 hat-tricks for Los Blancos in what was their biggest league win in 48-and-a-half years. It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he posted on Twitter after the game, saying: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support.' If the critics still see Ronaldo as greedy, it certainly paid off at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday. Premier League: Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Leicester City. La Liga: Malaga, Athletic Bilbao, Rayo Vallecano, Real Sociedad, Celta Vigo, Espanyol, Getafe, Levante, Eibar, Elche, Deportivo la Coruna, Almeria, Granada, Cordoba.

            "Formula One great Jackie Stewart has bemoaned the downfall of the German Grand Prix and is urging the sport's bosses not to forsake tradition for money as the number of European races on the calendar dwindles. The German GP was erased from the 2015 schedule because of financial problems and F1 commercial head Bernie Ecclestone could not guarantee the future of the iconic Italian Grand Prix. The race had been in doubt due to questions over which circuit would host the race, which has been shared between Hockenheim and Nurburgring in recent seasons. F1 races have started to move away from Europe towards lucrative venues in the Middle East . Nico Rosberg celebrates winning last year's German GP, which has been scrapped from the schedule . Officials from both circuits had voiced concern that time was running out to organise the race, which was scheduled to take place over the weekend of July 17-19. A short FIA statement said no agreement could be reached with Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder (CRH). 'The German Grand Prix has been withdrawn as the CRH and promoter did not reach agreement,' the statement said. The decision means the 2015 season will be shortened to 19 races, with a three-week break between the British Grand Prix on July 5 and the Hungarian Grand Prix on July 26. Former three-time world champion Jackie Stewart wants Europe's 'essential races' to remain unchanged . More races are heading to Asia and the Middle East. Stewart, a three-time world champion, says there should always be a place for the 'essential' races in Germany, Italy, Britain, France and Monaco as they helped 'motorsport to become what it is today.' Stewart told Sportsmail that it's 'terrific we're going to new countries but you still have to respect your heritage.'

            "Lada Niva 4x4 £13,395 on the road . As a result of the Land Rover Defender's demise, there could be a boom in sales of a Russian badge which was a butt of many jokes in the Soviet era – the Lada. Lada's 4x4 Niva has long been the car that bucked the trend of laughing at the Russian carmaker and has won fans around the world thanks to its robust nature and chunky looks. We take a look.

            "A judge said he had to deal with his own 'revulsion' as he jailed four care home assistants who called their dementia residents 'fugly' and told one she was living in a brothel. The women, who worked at the dementia unit of the Bupa-run facility, in Bretton, Cambridgeshire, told one woman she was going to be killed. Another confused patient was told she was living in a brothel and should expect male visitors. Chloe Pearsall, 26, (left) and Nicole Howley, 25 (right) committed the acts of abuse at the care home throughout 2013 they have been jailed along with their colleagues Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63 . All four workers ‘systematically’ abused residents until a whistleblower reported them to bosses. Nicole Howley, 25, was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of two charges of ill-treating a person as a carer under the Mental Capacity Act. Colleagues Chloe Pearsall, 26, Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63, were convicted of one count of the same offence and sentenced to nine months each. Sentencing the women, Judge Sean Enright said he had ‘put aside his own personal revulsion’ to find a ‘just, proportionate sentence’. Using the word ‘fugly’ demonstrated the ‘lack of respect’ they showed patients, he added, saying: ‘This was systematic ill-treatment.’ The case highlights the plight of many old and vulnerable people in the care system and hospitals. The Daily Mail has repeatedly called for improved standards under its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people. During a trial at Peterborough Magistrates Court earlier this year, co-worker Lanya Edwards described how the women, all from Peterborough, abused one resident with ‘quite advanced’ dementia. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire (pictured) has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people . The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013 and told one elderly resident that she was working in a brothel . ‘She would ask where she was a lot. I would say she was in a care home in Peterborough and she would be staying here until she got better,’ she said. ‘But I heard some care assistants tell her she was living in a brothel. She used to get quite worried. It is not a nice thing to hear.’ Miss Edwards said she heard Fisher, Holcroft and Howley taunting the women ‘at least a couple of times a week’. She also said she heard the women calling people ‘fugly’ behind their backs – although another witness, Jessica Skelly, told the court they used the term openly with at least one resident. ‘It was used to her. She used to get distressed and said she would phone the police,’ she said. Describing the vile abuse meted out to the woman who was told she was working in a brothel, she added: ‘Chloe, Jo and Nicole all referred to her as a prostitute… they said she wasn’t pulling her weight.’ Three of the workers regularly referred to one resident as a prostitute and told another she was fugly . After the group were found guilty, magistrates decided to send the case to Peterborough Crown Court for sentencing because their sentencing powers were insufficient to reflect the ‘gravitas of the offences and the vulnerability of the victims’. Andrew Hurst, representing the women on Wednesday, said they continued to deny the offences. They were all dismissed from their jobs in February last year. A spokesman for the care home said: ‘Everyone at the home is deeply shocked by the deplorable behaviour of these experienced carers.’ A fifth carer, Benjamin Appiah, denies ill-treating three women and will stand trial in June.\n",

            "No footballer has ever been late for kick-off because he was tied up negotiating a new contract. So, from the start, Raheem Sterling’s explanation for the end of his conversations with Liverpool did not stand up. It isn’t the talks that are the distraction. It is the thinking. No player is sat in an office haggling over image rights, only to check his watch at 3.30pm and bolt out of the door. A player may feel uncertainty about his future. His brain may whirl over where he will play next season. Liverpool? Arsenal? Abroad? Yet postponing the process to the end of the season doesn’t solve that issue. If anything, it makes it worse. If Sterling wanted to stop thinking right now, he could sign his new deal or tell Liverpool to come back in a year. He has, after all, got more than two seasons left on his existing arrangement. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling (right) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday giving his reasons for his decision . So all Sterling did, the day his advisers ended negotiations until May at the earliest, was complicate his affairs. It is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks, particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with Liverpool’s supporters. Without doubt, they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week’s ill-conceived BBC interview. As Liverpool’s hopes of a Champions League place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against Manchester United, Sterling bore the brunt of the dissent. In truth, his performance was little worse than any of his team-mates that day - but he is the one who is seen as disloyal, as rejecting at the first opportunity the club and manager that have best developed his game. Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done well by Sterling. They made him a key player in last season’s title near miss, got him to the World Cup. He owes them a little more respect than has been displayed in recent weeks. He owes them enough to know it is downright rude to talk of being flattered by Arsenal just days before the teams meet. Liverpool are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than £5million annually. Apparently not. Sterling (left) shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . Sterling has played in various positions this season under Rodgers - including as a striker and at wing back . Among the reasons advanced for Sterling’s coldness towards a long-term commitment at Liverpool has been Rodgers’s recent decision to play him at right wing back. This has been a result of injuries and suspensions, rather than a long-term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of English players, and why many might find their pathway blocked. Would a young player brought up through Ajax’s system, for instance, be so affronted by this temporary change? Why is it the English in particular that see football in straight lines? Sterling has played as a centre forward, a No 10, a wide midfielder and now a wing back. Isn’t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams? Isn’t this an education? Why is it that England produces pigeon-holed full backs or midfielders, and not footballers? Shouldn’t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of £100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere? Indeed, shouldn’t he welcome that endorsement from his manager? Arsenal progressed to the 2006 Champions League final at a time when Ashley Cole was injured. In his place through the knockout stages, home and away against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, was the 22-year-old French midfielder Mathieu Flamini. He hadn’t played full back in his entire professional career, he said. But he never complained, and Arsenal didn’t concede in any of his six matches. Midfielder Mathieu Flamini (right) was used a full back in Arsenal's run to the 2006 Champions League final . Flamini isn’t a creative in Sterling’s mould - but then right wing back isn’t the same as left back, either. Sterling is still operating as a winger when Liverpool attack. Flamini, a central midfielder, was used strictly as a defender. It wasn’t as if Arsene Wenger was gung-ho in those games: three ended goalless, two in 1-0 victories. Flamini performed with exceptional discipline. One imagines that midfielder Emre Can didn’t sign for Liverpool expecting to be part of a back three. Rodgers first used him as a defender this season against Burnley in December, and he has remained there ever since. Can is German, though, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture. World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back. Midfield lynchpin Bastian Schweinsteiger began his career as a right winger, while Thomas Muller can play centre forward, support striker, attacking midfielder and winger. Every player will have a favourite position but in England these desires become entrenched. Even the most gifted, such as Steven Gerrard, never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility. Maybe Sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than £100,000 a week. Because that player goes wherever his team needs him — and that makes him worth the coin. Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Emre Can (centre) has been used mainly in defence, despite being a midfielder .\n",

            "The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’\n",

            "While pounding on the treadmill day in and day out may work for some people, for others it is a torturous task that makes exercise nearly impossible to enjoy, let alone commit to. Enter 'Retrosweat'. Founded by former NIDA graduate Shannon Dooley, 30, the aerobics classes with a twist are all about 'making fitness fabulous'. Described as 'freestyle aerobic workout,' Retrosweat is inspired by the era of old-school VHS workouts made famous by Jane Fonda, and involves choreography to match the Eighties soundtrack. Scroll down for video . Getting physical: Shannon Dooley has founded 'Retrosweat' - an Eighties-inspired aerobics class in the style of Jane Fonda's iconic workouts . Skin and pins: Typical Retrosweat attire is all about showing off your legs in skimpy Eighties leotards . Pop it like it's hot: A Retrosweat class will have you popping, squatting and grinding to a retro soundtrack . A 50-minute workout, it has 12 dance tracks and Dooley regularly mixes up the soundtrack to keep people excited each week - and on their toes. 'There's a fusion of jogging, jumping, athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing' says Dooley. 'Basically there's a warm up, warm down, both high and medium impact movement that targets all areas of the body. 'There will be a leg track with squats and lunges and an arm track with push ups.' Eighties alter ego: Dooley says class goers  tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows . Iconic: Olivia Newton-John's aerobic anthem Let's Get Physical inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble . 'Being freestyle though, I like to change up the tracks and let people request songs, but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week.' It also promises to have you 'sweating litres, laughing loads and getting buns of steel and a core to die for.' And according to Dooley, there's nothing else like it on the market. 'What makes it different is it's theatrical - people can come into a space that’s all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour,' says Dooley. 'Not to mention being physically and creatively expressive while getting exercise they need.' And it's not just for those stuck in a Eighties time warp either. Tutti Frutti - In Summer Dooley adds 'Pineapple squat challenge' a modern take on a kettlebell workout . 'The demographic is quite wide. We have girls in their early twenties that come, ladies in their thirties, ladies in their forties who used to listen to Eighties music during high school, women in early sixties who are relieved freestyle movement is back and who used to do it five times a week in the Eighties.' 'Oh and we definitely have men come along too,  they love it.' Overall Dooley says people just like to come along because they love Eighties music, want to put an amazing costume on, feel fabulous - and release endorphins - 'It’s one big healthy party!' When asked where she got her inspiration,  surprisingly it wasn't from watching her mum do Jane Fonda workouts. Diva demographic: Dooley say there's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties . 'No strangely. My mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes I watched my mum do tap exams,' says Dooley. 'She is though an amazing choreographer so that’s where I get my inspiration from.' As for attire? 'I wouldn’t turn away anyone who isn’t in a leotard,' laughs Dooley. 'But as people come back, gradually each week they will start to build collection. A leotard from eBay, leg warmers from American Apparel and after a while they build this whole alter ego and when then they will come in wearing a G-string leotard and no one will even blink.' On her own wardrobe, Dooley takes her job very seriously, admitting she's never worn the same outfit twice, 'an I've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now' - (65 leotards to be precise). Fit and fun: Dooley says unlike  treadmill workouts, Retrosweat is about having fun and forgetting it's fitness . 'I like to set the standards through my face, hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves,' she says. Aside from the costumes, music and theatrics, Dooley also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off Seventies and Nineties classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers. 'In summer, we do the pineapple squat challenge - so someone in the room will hold a pineapple in the squat track (which weighs about 2kgs) and it works just like a kettlebell, except your using the resistance of pineapple. Fonda fitspo: Dooley credits Jane Fonda as one of her main sources of inspiration behind Retrosweat . 'When we do Seventies class I will mix it up with a disco ball!' Dooley says the Seventies and Nineties nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves, as well as give herself a break from Eighties decade for a bit. 'Nineties goes off, we dance to fresh prince and that classic song ‘Sing hallelujah!’ So with all this fun and flair, how does the fitness measure up? 'For me, other than getting people to smile, escape life for an hour and enjoy themselves, the best feedback I get is about fitness. People will say, I lost four kilos and I didn't even notice!' says Dooley. 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves': Dooley says those with two left feet won't have any difficulty . 'A lot of exercise these days is scientific, counting reps and scooping protein powder. I respect that but that’s not me. My exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun, and I know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine,' says Dooley. 'People want variation, they want a ballad and they want to go nuts when the chorus hits. And the great thing about using songs is they're only 3.5-4 minutes long so there’s comfort in the fact you’re jumping up and down  but there's ‘just one more chorus’ and then we’ll be done.' So for Dooley it all just boils down to getting people excited and wanting to have a 'bodacious body.' 'I love seeing people improve their quality of life through the magic of music and star jumps - as sentimental as that sounds.' As for those with two left feet, Dooley says you won't have any trouble. Baby one more time: Every now and again a Seventies or Nineties class is thrown into the mix, which Dooley says 'go off' 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves. I think it's much more enjoyable to do simple moves well and enjoy it than struggle with something complicated and not enjoy it. So whether you've never danced or are a dancer who wants to keep their skills up,  Retrosweat is all about simplicity and completely inclusive.' And it seems this 'blast from the past' class is only growing. Dooley now runs additional side business 'Dial-a-sweat' where she takes hens parties for a class, and has travelled all around Sydney from Bowral, Newport and Kirrabilli overlooking the harbour bridge. And with two current locations in Alexandria and Surry Hills that run weekly (and Bondi for a while), Dooley believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things. 'I want the whole world Retrosweating, that’s the plan.' 'And if I have too much make-up on and have sweat running on my face then that’s all part of it.'\n",

            "Police in Maryland are hunting for a 'heartless' thief who stole a four-year-old boy's wheelchair in the middle of the night. The youngster's mother left the buggy in the lobby of their building on Merrimac Drive, Langley Park, as usual on Sunday evening since it's easier to carry her son to their second floor apartment. But when she went to retrieve the stroller the following morning, it had reportedly disappeared. Scroll down for videos . Caught on camera: Police in Maryland are hunting for a 'heartless' thief (seen above on CCTV footage) who stole a four-year-old boy's wheelchair in the middle of the night. Distraught: The youngster's mother left the wheelchair in the lobby of their building on Merrimac Drive, Langley Park, as usual on Sunday evening since it's easier to carry her son to their second floor apartment . Prince George's County Police have released a piece of surveillance footage which shows a person pushing the empty chair in a parking lot. They're asking anyone with information about the case to contact investigators. The film appears to show a dark-haired white male dressed in a jacket and pants. A cash reward is being offered. Commenting on the incident, Capt. Ken Humbel said: 'This family already faces challenges and shouldn't be burdened with the emotional and financial stress of the theft of this wheelchair. Flashback: The boy's mother has shared a video of her son using his chair  in a bid to trigger tip offs . 'The suspect we’re looking for has no heart.' Anyone with information about the theft is being urged to call police at 301-699-2601 or Crime Solvers at 866-411-TIPS. The boy's mother has also shared a video of her son using his chair with the community in a bid to trigger tip offs. While officers search for the suspect, they're in talks with a foundation that may help find a replacement chair in the meantime. They did not say why the boy uses the wheelchair, citing privacy concerns.\n",

            "MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain’s nuclear, transport and public services after suicide pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster. And concerns are so great that one security source has warned: ‘However much physical security you have, if someone is already in there, there’s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism.’ MI5 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas – known as ‘insiders’ – highlighted by the Germanwings disaster. Warning: MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain’s nuclear, transport and public services after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public. But a BA pilot, who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world, claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks. The pilot, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘British Airways is more interested in checking whether I have a hernia than mental health. ‘There is no testing regarding mental health.’ A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. The CPNI has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat, including theft, revenge, a hunger for notoriety, political or religious ideology and fear or coercion, where external pressure is exerted on a worker. Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment. Disturbingly, it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue. Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information – such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden – process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage. The security source said: ‘Years ago, the emphasis was on external security. Now ‘‘the insider’’ is the growing threat, as seen in the cases of Edward Snowden and Lubitz. ‘We advise companies to look closely at their personnel. The higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment, the closer they should be monitored.’\n",

            "Tom Ince scored two fantastic goals in front of his dad as Derby twice came from behind to share the points in a thrilling 4-4 draw at Huddersfield. Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Scannell, Gobern, Coady (Hogg 81), Butterfield, James, Wells (Bunn 88), Miller . Subs not used: Edgar, Murphy, Wallace, Lolley, Billing . Booked: James, Butterfield . Scorers: Gobern 38, Hudson 41, James 45, Wells 72 . Derby (4-4-2): Grant, Shotton, Keogh, Whitbread (Christie 27), Warnock, Hendrick, Hughes (Russell 79), Bryson (Dawkins 9), Ince, Bent, Lingard . Subs not used: Forsyth, Ward, Sammon, Roos . Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.\n",

            "It is a common fear, known as trypanophobia. For around 20 per cent of the population, the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep-rooted sense of dread. Many avoid the doctor's surgery altogether, leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections. But for those terrified of needles, a team of scientists at Rice University in Houston, may have the answer. They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin. Scroll down for video . Comfortably Numb is a new, single-use device that eases the pain of an injection by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin within 60 seconds . Three first year students, (from L-R) mechanical engineer Mike Hua, bioengineer Andy Zhang and computer scientist Greg Allison, came up with the invention, they describe as 'simple and elegant' The trio, made up of computer scientist Greg Allison, bioengineer Andy Zhang and mechanical engineer Mike Hua, currently has a functioning prototype, that has produced a numbing effect in just 60 seconds. 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' Current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately, or take too long, the researchers said. They noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work, whereas their new device 'works on the order of seconds and minutes', Mr Zhang said. 'We are targeting anyone who has to get an injection, which is nearly everyone,' Mr Allison said. 'But the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain.' As such, he said, it is particularly useful for children and the elderly. And, it is intended for use during procedures 'where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body, such as the face or the groin', he added. The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (£1.34) to produce, they said . The trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing, and help reduce swelling. 'We looked into all sorts of methods for numbing, both quick and long-term, chemicals, using ice packs - which is similar to what we're using now,' Mr Hua said. The device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water. A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'We explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming.' 'At the end of the day, what we're creating is a self-contained device with a very cold contact surface, and there are many applications for that,' Mr Allison added. Some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree, or skills the first-year students had not yet learned. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. 'Because we don't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas, that meant we had to think of very simple solutions. 'Being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative, but at the same time, simple and elegant.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. Mr Zhang, said: 'The materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance: plastic, rubber and metal. The team from Rice University in Houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos, or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain . 'The materials for one of these cost about a quarter, and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost. 'We compared our device to similar things already in production, and we've estimated the cost at about $2 (£1.34).' The team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device, and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to Rice in their second year. 'As a team, we just want to follow the project, because we think it has a lot of potential. I think that's what drew us to this specific project,' Mr Allison said. 'We haven't really discussed yet whether we're going dedicate to making this a company, but it's something we're open to.'\n",

Eathan Cruse, 19, one of the five men taken into custody after raids on Saturday morning, said officers assaulted him after he had been handcuffed . 'He said 'yeah, that's the one'... he kicks me right across the face as my hands were cuffed.' Eathan was released later in the day. His father, Glen, also said he was brutally attacked by police during the raid, and  his son was hospitalised as a result of injuries he sustained. 'I got a boot right in the head and they said 'Shut up you Abo', and I could hear Eathan … getting knocked out cold,' he said, according to Fairfax Media. Eathan said the police officer grabbed and handcuffed him and asked: 'What's your name?'... and I said Eathan,' before assaulting him . Eathan was released later in the day after his initial arrest . 'They smashed him to the ground, and I could hear this, just stomping, stomping.' He also  his family was the only one treated in this way during the raids. 'We are the [only] indigenous family of the lot, and we got the worst treatment,' he said. Victoria Police confirmed  a complaint had been made in regards to the  treatment of Mr Cruse, and said it had 'been referred to referred to (the) professional standards command'.

            "A man, 21, allegedly forced a tearful 15-year-old girl into his car on Saturday and screamed, 'you will never see your parents again!' in attempt to force her to be his teen bride. Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper: Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .\n",

            "Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton got her budding presidential campaign's first targeted question about the deadly 2012 Benghazi terror attacks on Tuesday night, and her answer was the sound of one hand clapping. The bash-the-rich candidate flew first class from Boston to Washington, D.C. after wrapping up a two-day New Hampshire campaign trip. Daily Mail Online was on the flight. 'Mrs. Clinton, when are you going to start talking to the press about Benghazi?' Daily Mail Online asked her in the Washington Reagan National Airport terminal. 'Did you make mistakes?' The usually garrulous and broad-smiling Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service and local police escorts, and said nothing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012 . DEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya . WRONG: Both President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Clinton incorrectly blamed the Benghazi attacks on protests sparked by a YouTube video mocking Islam's prophet Muhammad. The two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four Americans who were killed at the scene . Moments earlier, she answered a question about why her taxpayer-funded security detail had sped at 80 MPH past exits for the smaller Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and trekked all the way to Boston for a flight with first class seats. 'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't,' Clinton said. The Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah's military-style Benghazi attacks will likely be a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. The group laid waste to a State Department facility while she was America's top diplomat. A special congressional committee chaired by South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, has a mandate to investigate the episode through January 2017, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to put the issue behind her. TROUBLE AHEAD: New Hampshire resident Brian Blackden included 'Benghazi blood' Tuesday on a sign listing reasons 'Hillary is a liar,' near the site of a Clinton appearance at the New Hampshire Technical Institute . On Sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with Dartmouth College students in Hanover, New Hampshire, 22 of them made references to Bengahzi when asked about Clinton's chances of becoming president. Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened. 'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online. He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office. 'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.' NOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate – angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groups . CASUALTIES: US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith (left), US Navy SEAL Glen Doherty (center) and US Nacy SEAL Tyrone Woods (right) perished in the Ansar al-Shariah attacks in Benghazi . Four Americans lost their lives in the September 11, 2012 terror attacks, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, the first American ambassador killed while on duty since 1979. U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith also perished in the initial barrage of mortars and automatic weapons fire. Hours later, a second wave of attacks hit a CIA annex compound nearby, killing CIA contract soldiers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both U.S. Navy SEALs. The four men came home in flag-draped caskets. Congressional Republicans want answers about Clinton's involvement in what they see as a potential cover-up of facts surrounding how the attacks unfolded and why – and how the Obama administration explained it afterward, just weeks before an election. Part of the swirling controversy involves a home-brew email server that Clinton exclusively used for her official electronic communications while she was secretary of state. Clinton never used an official 'state-dot-gov' email address, but told reporters on March 10 that she had given the State Department copes of 'official' emails – and acknowledged deciding herself which ones qualified. She deleted the rest, some 32,000 messages in all. Clinton's attorney has refused to hand over the server to congressional investigators. Gowdy, the Benghazi committee chairman, wants a neutral third-party to examine it and determine if Benghazi-related emails can be recovered. His committee said Wednesday that its report on the Benghazi attacks won't likely be finished until 2016, putting its release squarely in the middle of the presidential campaign's most hotly contested months. But the committee said in a statement that 'Secretary Clinton’s decision to seek the presidency of the United States does not and will not impact the work of the committee.' Clinton's State Department infamously declined to provide her Benghazi outpost with the beefed-up security presence its station chief requested in the weeks preceding the deadly Ansar al-Shariah attacks. She claimed later that she never saw the requests, insisting that such routine diplomatic cables would never have made it to her desk, even if they were addressed to her. FIRST CLASS: Hillary (seated at the front, right) traveled in luxury from Boston to Washington, seated next to chief of staff Huma Abedin, after am 80 MPH Secret Service dash to Logan International Airport . FAREWELL: Hillary Clinton waved at the end of her final campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday, before hitting the road to Boston for the same Washington-bound flight that Daily Mail Online flew on . In the days following the attacks, Clinton said publicly that it was the result of a spontaneous protest over a YouTube video made by an American – a film that insulted the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Such protests were seen in other Muslim countries, but U.S. intelligence determined in real-time that the Benghazi attacks were well-organized and easily traced back to an Islamist terror network. Months later, following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about Benghazi, she testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Just days earlier, lawmakers disclosed that a top U.S. diplomat told them 'everyone' at the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi knew 'from the beginning' that they were in the middle of a terrorist attack. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton told the senators. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans?' 'What difference at this point does it make?'\n",

            "The parents of a Slovakian model accused of murdering her British millionaire ex-boyfriend are being forced to sell their house to pay her legal bills. Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush’s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush’s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was ‘crazy’ with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova’s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest: ‘We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.’ Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of £73,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years. Mayka Marica Kukucova, pictured after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia . Ms Kukucova had given herself up in her home town which is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Spain . 'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than £59,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom. He said: 'I am sure that it will not be easy to sell this house - at least not for that money.' The model has been locked up in the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga since she was extradited last May . Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested last year .\n",

            "A British former car mechanic who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria. Hamayun Tariq, a divorced 37-year-old who was born and raised in Dudley in the West Midlands, shared four images on Twitter of a room where he claims to make devices known as IEDs. Components are seen organised on shelves and instruction manuals and bomb-making equipment neatly laid out on work surfaces in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state'. Scroll down for video . Well-equipped: British former car mechanic Hamayun Tariq -  who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper - has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria . Boastful: Components are seen organised on shelves in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state' Tariq's social media presence rarely last longer than a few days before being suspended as he specialises in posting detailed instructions on how to build bombs. Despite already doing the same on his latest account, the militant has been able to share images of his bomb-making factory, where he boastfully claims to spend time 'producing sophisticated IEDs'. Terror: Hamayun Tariq is a divorced, 37-year-old father-of-two who was born and raised in Dudley . Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their function. He clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory. After posting photographs of his 'laboratory', the jihadi wrote on Twitter: 'IEDs is my favourite weapon after Sniping, u hit the enemy & disappear in thin air just like a Ghost. Its a Must'. Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria late last year. Shortly after joining the terrorist group he began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' still living in the West to carry out deadly bomb attacks. Tariq has previously posted under various Twitter handles but he is usually suspended rarely quickly thanks to bomb-making guides and sickening calls for terror attacks in the UK. He regularly posted photographs of handwritten instructions explaining how to assemble crude explosive devices and listing the chemicals needed to create deadly poisons. Chilling: Hamayun Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their functionality . Sick: Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria last year. He soon began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' to carry out deadly bomb attacks . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. Tariq's Twitter rants appear to have been in retaliation for him allegedly having his British passport revoked in 2013. One of his most widely shared messages was a sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message was page after page of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. Tariq previously claimed to have encountered up to 40 other British nationals in his first seven weeks as an ISIS fighter in Syria, according to the Guardian, who spoke to him via Twitter's private messaging function on a now disabled account. Describing himself as 'really happy' to have joined the terror group, he reportedly added that he had also met a 'fixer' who was smuggling 1,000 new recruits into ISIS-held areas of Syria every week. He reportedly told the newspaper that he first embraced radical Islam in 2000. Tariq was arrested for fraud in Wolverhampton in 2005 but fled to Pakistan to avoid the case going to trial. He was deported back to Britain two years later and served three and a half years in prison. He claims to have left Britain immediately after his release in 2012 and moved to the Waziristan region of north west Pakistan, where he joined the local Taliban branch. Expensive: Hamayun Tariq clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory . One of Tariq's most widely shared messages was this sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message posted on this long-disabled account was a copy of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook . In September or early October Tariq is understood to have been contacted by ISIS fixers who paid for his transport to join the terror group in Syria. He was trained as a sniper before moving on to specialise in explosives - a subject he has been interested in since studying for a GCSE in Science in the mid-1990s. Tariq described his new life under ISIS as far more comfortable than that in Pakistan. 'Life was tough in Waziristan but here I can't believe I get a salary, I get rent. They even paid for my transport. I'm really happy here and all the guys I've met from the UK are also happy and settled,' he was quoted as saying. The Home Office would not speak about Tariq's claim that his passport had been cancelled, saying they could not comment on individual cases. However they did add that in a broader sense any individual who has conducted himself 'in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK' can have their citizenship revoked. The Home Office has said there are at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, although a number of experts believe the real figure is likely to greatly exceed that.\n",

            "West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes filling your home ground is paramount to Premier League clubs - with the Hammers announcing their new season-ticket structure ahead of the move to the Olympic Stadium. Karren Brady, vice-chairman of West Ham, announced during the week that the club would be making significant cuts to their current pricing as the move is being offset against increased television revenue. The cheapest season ticket at Upton Park is £620 but there will be £289 seats on offer from the 2016-17 season - the club's first in the 54,000-seater Olympic Stadium. West Ham's season tickets will cost as little as £289 when the club move to the Olympic Stadium next year . Manager Sam Allardyce says filling the stadium is the most important thing for any football club . West Ham's vice-chairman Karren Brady visited the club's future home in Stratford on Tuesday . And Allardyce believes performing in front of a sold-out crowd is something that should not go unappreciated as the other 19 Premier League clubs are now being pushed to follow West Ham's lead. 'The most important thing at a football club is to fill the stadium,' he said. 'I think filling the stadium is the ultimate for the success of the team. Obviously it's not from a revenue base like it used to be. 'The revenue base for a football club used to be the sustainability of the football club in my years before the Premier League and before Sky made it a worldwide brand. A view of the Olympic Stadium on Tuesday ahead of West Ham's switch to the 54,000-capacity arena . 'It's about creating the atmosphere in a stadium that thrills not only the fans there enjoying the atmosphere, but the players who respond to that . 'To make sure everywhere you go in the Premier League maintains a high level of attendance and selling out your stadium has to be the ultimate goal for any Premier League football club, for me. An artist's impression of what the Olympic Stadium will look like during a West Ham match . 'What we've announced has to be the best piece of business, for me, seen in the Premier League for a long, long time. 'Hopefully everybody at West Ham football club, particularly the fan, will come and enjoy, as Karren says, a fantastic facility for less. That will only encourage future young West Ham supporters to be West Ham supporters.'\n",

            "Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' Allegations: The rapidly-expanding mobile taxi service has been plagued by claims that drivers are not vetted .

            "David Luiz should not play in central defence again after his horror show in PSG's 3-1 defeat against Barcelona, according to former England boss Glenn Hoddle. The ex-Chelsea defender came off the bench in Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final first leg and was nutmegged twice by Luis Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's two goals. Luiz suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but Hoddle, who insists that the Brazilian has always been a defensive liability, believes he still showed his naivety even if he wasn't fully fit. Luis Suarez puts the ball through David Luiz's legs on his way to scoring his second goal of the night . Luiz suffered the same fate when Suarez weaved his way into the box for Barcelona's second goal . The Brazilian was left with his head in his hands after allowing Suarez a clean run at goal . Asked about Luiz's defending for Barcelona's third goal, the Sky Sports pundit said: 'Even if you're not 100 per cent fit you can't show that lack of intent. 'He's the last man on the pitch when Suarez picks the ball up and starts running at him. He realises he's the last man and the very last thing (you should do) when you're last man is jump in. You bide time for your team to get around you. 'He does what an eight year old who hasn't been coached does. He tries to win it by putting both of his feet together but when he does that he can't move anywhere. Suarez nutmegs him again.' Some of Luiz's best performances for PSG - and former club Chelsea - came when he was deployed in a central midfield role with less defensive responsibility, something Hoddle believes manager Laurent Blanc should consider from now on. Sky Sports pundit Glenn Hoddle described Luiz as a 'liability at the back' after PSG's defeat . Luiz defended like an 'eight-year-old who hasn't been coached' in this challenge, according to Hoddle . Suarez tucks home the first of his two goals against PSG after nutmegging Luiz with ease . He added: 'For me he's a liability at the back. He always has been. You have to find a place (for him) in midfield or even at right back. 'He's a footballer who likes to play in the playground when there's no shape to the game. He's a talent but that's not what top football is about.' However Hoddle's fellow pundit, former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, was quick to point the blame in the direction of Blanc, who chose to introduce the 25-year-old after an injury to Thiago Silva. Henry said: 'If David Luiz wasn't fit enough to start the game, why does he come on as a sub after 21 minutes? Luiz looks dejected after contributing to his side's 3-1 defeat in their Champions League quarter-final first leg . Jamie Redknapp also admitted that Luiz can be a liability but Thierry Henry questioned the player's fitness . 'From a coaching point of view, why would you put him in? If he's not fit enough to start, why do you put him in?' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp, who was also in the Sky Sports studio, showed some sympathy for Luiz but pointed towards the sheer number of high-profile errors made by the former Benfica man in recent seasons. Responding to Henry, Redknapp said: 'I do agree with you but I've seen him do that every single week in the Premier League. 'That's one of the reasons Chelsea were quick to get rid of him. Defensively, at times, he's a liability.'\n",

            "In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield secured a 38-14 Super League victory against Catalans Dragons to end a three-match losing run. Murphy, player of the month for February and March, went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass. He was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai, who also scored twice, caught and off-loaded a kick from Danny Brough on 37 minutes. In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons . Former Wakefield Wildcats star Murphy, 27, has now scored six tries in his last five appearances. Having fallen behind Catalans hit back to lead 8-6 - with scrum-half Scott Dureau bagging all of their points. He scored a try on 21 minutes when Elliot Whitehead passed inside after a solo dash past two players split the Giants defence. Dureau converted and then added a penalty goal on 24 minutes for a poor shoulder charge on him by Joe Wardle. Wardle was restored to the Giants line-up after being suspended for last week's defeat by St Helens for a dangerous throw on Ben Cockayne. Huddersfield responded with three tries in 10 minutes at the end of the first half - and it could have been more. Connor nearly put Murphy in again down the left on 27 minutes while Leroy Cudjoe was held up on the right flank after Brough's break from deep. In between Ta'ai pounced for a try when a Dragons defender fumbled a high kick from Brough on 30 minutes. Scotland star Brough, whose kicking caused problems for the visitors all game, was at it twice more before half-time. His kick led to Murphy's second try and then another Brough bomb was dropped on the hooter by a defender and Cudjoe pounced. Brough, who took his tally to 58 points for the season with three earlier conversions, this time hit the post. Huddersfield led 22-8 at the break, with the sides trading tries after the restart as Catalans narrowed the gap to 26-14. Julian Bousquet scored a converted try on 45 minutes while Jermaine McGillvary went over at the other end eight minutes later. There was controversy on 62 minutes when a simmering feud between Cudjoe and Willie Tong boiled over. The pair seemed to exchange words and former NRL star Tong responded by appearing to headbutt Cudjoe right in front of referee Robert Hicks. Tong was sin-binned and Cudjoe got a verbal warning in the presence of Giants skipper Brough. Huddersfield took full advantage of the extra man by running in two quick tries, first from Ta'ai a minute later and then Scott Grix on 65 minutes. There was no further score, but Louis Anderson lost his temper late on as Huddersfield defensively shut the game down.\n",

            "A Pakistani man suspected of killing his fiancee and nine of her relatives after they appeared to be reluctant to give her permission to marry - months after he allegedly murdered his own parents. The 25-year-old suspect, who has been identified as Gul Ahmad Saeed, is alleged to have shot dead his fiancee, her parents and seven of her siblings on Sunday, police have said. Their deaths came just months after he is alleged to have killed his own parents, brother and sister-in-law after they objected to the match. Frustrated: Gul Ahmad Saeed is alleged to have gone on a killing spree after becoming angry with people obstructing his wedding plans. Pictured: Stock image of Pakistani brides and grooms at a mass wedding . Saeed has been on the run ever since, but returned to his home town in town in north-west Pakistan at the weekend - at which point he is suspected of killing his fiancee's family with the help of accomplices. He is said to have been outraged over her uncle's dithering over the marriage. 'The uncle was being very indecisive about the wedding which infuriated Gul Ahmad,' said police officer Mohammad Jamil. Police were searching for the suspects but they were believed to have fled into the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, where government authorities hold little sway and police are not legally permitted to go. 'We cannot follow anyone there since it is beyond our jurisdiction, and our security would be threatened,' said Jamil. Fled: Saeed, 25, is now said to be in the semi-autonomous Pashtun area, on the border with Afghanistan . The killings took place in a deeply conservative area where women there are often discouraged from going to school and have little choice when it comes to marriage. Pakistani women are often killed by men who feel their honour has been offended in some way. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 869 women were murdered in so-called honour killings in 2013, the last year for which data is available.\n",

            "Concerns are growing over Russian ships that have docked in a once-secret  naval base in the Arctic. Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship – equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship (back left) as it passes through the English Channel in February . Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over £390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just £3.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels. A former second in command for the Norwegian military said: 'Russia is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business. It's clear, very few people know what happens on these vessels.' Jan Reksten believes the sale of Olavsvern was 'a double loss' as 'Norway's armed forces lost an important base and now there are Russian vessels docked there'.\n",

            "JT’s NEVER BEEN BETTER . Jose Mourinho's return was the answer to John Terry’s prayers. Mourinho said Sunday's game at the Emirates was the best Terry had ever played. That was a pat on the back for his captain but also justification for Mourinho’s faith in playing him. Terry is in a real purple patch and his reading of the game is better than ever. Part of his success comes from the way the team is set up in front of him. All of their good work means he is in prime position each time to make the telling tackle or interception. John Terry (left) was in inspiring form in the Chelsea defence as his side kept a clean sheet against Arsenal . Sportsmail's Martin Keown says the Blues skipper is enjoying some of the best football of his career . The 34-year-old defender's timing in the tackle has been impeccable for the majority this season . His decision-making is excellent and he waits for the perfect moment to get involved — there can be an element of gambling with that but it is a calculated risk. He was always able to anticipate where Arsenal wanted to play the game and stop them from doing it. As Chelsea have become harder to beat, Terry has come into his own. Following an entertaining first half, Arsenal's tempo appeared to drop after the half time break . GHOSTS OF MONACO? In the first half Arsenal played at a terrific tempo, especially down the left, but the whistle came at the perfect time for Chelsea. After the break Arsenal didn’t move the ball quickly enough. They looked mindful of the Monaco game where they lost control but here there was not enough spark. Gunners striker Olivier Giroud had a frustrating afternoon against a rugged Chelsea defence . Danny Welbeck's pace through the middle could have instead caused the Chelsea back line a lot trouble . A MISSED OPPORTUNITY . I’m a big fan of Olivier Giroud but Arsenal needed to ask a different question of the Chelsea defence. John Terry and Gary Cahill are built to deal with players like Giroud and everything was played in front of them. If Danny Welbeck had played through the middle, his pace could have unsettled Chelsea. It’s much easier to be compact when there’s no threat in behind. The Arsenal supporters were heard lamenting Chelsea's 'boring' performance at the Emirates Stadium . Despite many questioning Chelsea's tactics in the big games Jose Mourinho's team are in full control . JOSE IS ALWAYS THE BOSS . The Arsenal fans said it was boring but Chelsea are doing what they need to do to see out a championship. There is no problem with that. If anything that element of control is something Arsenal would do well to copy. Yes, there was no striker but could Didier Drogba really play three games in a row at 37? Jose just made good use of his squad. At the start of the season Chelsea played with so much expression it looked like the players were in charge. Now they look dogged, disciplined and firmly in control. There is no doubt as to who is the boss now.\n",

            "Thierry Henry believes Arsenal need to sign four new players this summer if they are to challenge for the Premier League title next season. 'Arsenal need to buy four players, they need that spine,' the Frenchman told Sky Sports. 'They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I’m afraid, they need a top, top-quality striker in order to win this league again.' Here, Sportsmail’s Simon Jones analyses the possible options for Arsenal in key positions. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be looking to add to his squad ahead of the 2015-16 Premier League season . GOALKEEPERS . PETR CECH . Chelsea . Cost: £10million . Jose Mourinho says it will cost 'huge money' for Cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence. Paris Saint-Germain remain the front-runners for his signature although Liverpool maintain hope too. The figures and Cech's age would normally act as a deterrent for the cash-conscious Arsene Wenger. However, Cech's experience could settle an often nervy defence and lift the performance levels of those around him. Petr Cech looks set to leave Chelsea after losing his No 1 spot to Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois . BERND LENO . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: £12million . Arsenal have a keen interest in the 23-year-old German Under 21 international. He already has good experience having made his Champions League debut against Chelsea in 2011 at 19. Arsenal scouts watching his team-mate Lars Bender have been impressed and Leno is interested in a move. His contract runs to 2018 but he said: 'The foreign option is certainly appealing. A new language, a new culture - that I could definitely imagine.' Bernd Leno pulls off a brilliant save during Bayer Leverkusen's 1-1 Bundesliga draw against Cologne . MATTIA PERIN . Genoa . Cost: £16million . Arsenal have pondered the experience of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, the promise of Mainz's Loris Karius but Mattia Perin at Genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists. He is 22 and tipped to become the new Gianluigi Buffon but Arsenal have watched him for three years now. Liverpool have also considered him as have Inter Milan. Another option with Premier League experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is Asmir Begovic of Stoke City. Arsenal have been scouting 22-year-old Genoa goalkeeper Mattia Perin for the past three years . DEFENDERS . ALEKSANDAR DRAGOVIC . Dinamo Kiev . Cost: £12million . Dragovic has been watched several times by Arsenal scouts. The Austria international is the subject of interest from Inter Milan and they are keen to strike a deal at the end of the season. Manchester United and West Ham have also watched Dragovic after first being alerted when he played for Basle alongside Fabian Schar. Arsenal though remain unsure Dragovic is for them. The Gunners have been keeping track of Aleksandar Dragovic but the Austrian is a target for Inter Milan . AYMEN ABDENNOUR . Monaco . Cost: £10million . The 25-year-old Tunisia international has not long extended his contract until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal who have had scouts posted at most Monaco games throughout the season. They are well aware of Abdennour, who has over 30 international caps and has progressed from his time at Toulouse. He is left-sided, has good pace and can pass well. He also had the measure of Olivier Giroud at the Emirates in February. Newcastle and Tottenham have checked on him also. Aymen Abdennour has not long extended his Monaco deal until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal . HECTOR MORENO . Espanyol . Cost: £8million . Arsenal scout Brian McDermott checked on Moreno last January as the Mexico international made his return to fitness from a broken leg he suffered last summer. They have maintained their interest in the 27-year-old who is highly rated by former coach Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. He is up for sale as Espanyol look to raise funds and has made 23 appearances since December. He was sent off in the derby against Barcelona at the weekend and could prove a cheaper back-up option. Hector Moreno (left) could be leaving Espanyol as the Spanish club look to raise funds this summer . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS . GEOFFREY KONDOGBIA . Monaco . Cost: £20million . Arsenal are back on the trail of Kondogbia after he impressed against them in the Champions League. Liverpool have also watched the 22-year-old Frenchman but Wenger and Champions League football will strengthen Arsenal's hand if they choose to step up interest. Much depends how Francis Coquelin performs between now and the end of the season but Kondogbia is a player of great potential. Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia would give Arsene Wenger an alternative to Francis Coquelin . MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN . Southampton . Cost: £30million . Like Lars Bender of Bayer Leverkusen and Moussa Sissoko at Newcastle, Schneiderlin is a player who has been long admired by Wenger. He is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from Arsenal. Southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked players to replace him should he go. Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool have also looked at the 25-year-old France international, who is one of the league's best midfielders. Morgan Schneiderlin (centre) has long been admired by Wenger and looks set to leave Southampton . JAMES McCARTHY . Everton . Cost: £30million . Everton do not wish to sell but McCarthy is a player Arsenal like a lot. Tottenham's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell also has the Republic of Ireland international high on his wishlist and the north London neighbours will test Everton's resolve as they formalise summer plans. McCarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience. Highly regarded by his team-mates and coaches alike, he can also play a more advanced role if required. James McCarthy celebrates scoring Everton's opening goal against Manchester United on Sunday . CENTRE FORWARDS . MARIO MANDZUKIC . Atletico Madrid . Cost: £20million . Aggressive, skilful and a goalscorer. Mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give Arsenal an edge they lack. He fell out with Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and his relationship with Diego Simeone has been strained. His representatives have already sounded out Premier League clubs and he seems intent on a move to England. Wenger wanted him last summer but the Croat was keen to replace Diego Costa at Atletico. Mario Mandzukic seems intent on a move to England and Wenger wanted the striker last summer . ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE . Lyon . Cost: £25million . Cash-strapped Lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with Manchester City and Liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season. He has 28 goals in 32 games, breaking club records, but has struggled against the top sides. Still only 23, Lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man. Fits Arsenal's style and life with Wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious Frenchman. Alexandre Lacazette (right) has scored 28 goals in 32 games for Lyon so far this season . EDINSON CAVANI . Paris Saint-Germain . Cost: £35million . Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris for the past year and Juventus are very keen. His representatives held talks with Manchester United last year and he was ready to join prior to David Moyes departing. PSG do not wish to sell though and Arsenal have been considering other options such as Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain, Mattia Destro at Roma and Palermo's Paulo Dybala, but he is keen to stay in Italy. Edinson Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris and has been linked to Arsenal .\n",

            "UEFA have sensationally charged Pep Guardiola for wearing a t-shirt demanding justice for a journalist who died at last summer’s World Cup. Argentine Jorge Lopez was killed in a suspicious road accident while in Sao Paulo in July. Guardiola was sporting the top - which read ‘#JusticiaParaTopo’ - during his pre-match press conference before Bayern Munich emphatically dumped Porto out of the Champions League. The message appeared to support a campaign to investigate Lopez’s death. UEFA have charged Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola after he wore this t-shirt in a press conference . Guardiola wore the top demanding justice for Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez who died in a car crash at the World Cup . UEFA say Guardiola has been disciplined because of an ‘incident of a non-sporting nature’ Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car . Lopez was killed when a taxi he was traveling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car being chased by police. UEFA revealed that the Spanish manager had been disciplined because of an ‘incident of a non-sporting nature’, in a move likely to cause public outcry. The European governing body’s disciplinary regulations read: ‘A breach of these principles is committed by anyone who uses sporting events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature.’ They are to review the case on May 21. On wearing the shirt, Guardiola said: ‘Last week, the family has given me the T-shirt. I woke up this morning and knew that I would put it.’ Lopez was a highly regarded journalist in South America and his passing drew huge outpouring from the very top of the game. Last year Atletico Madrid boss and former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone tweeted that Lopez was ‘not only a great journalist’ but ‘also a friend’ after hearing of the news. Lionel Messi dedicated Argentina's World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old, who died in Sao Paolo . FIFA, Diego Simeone and Javier Mascherano have also paid tribute to Lopez (pictured with Alfredo de Stefano) Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was working for La Red Radio at the World Cup in Brazil, as well as Ole and Spanish publications AS and Sport. Married to Marca's Argentina correspondent, Veronica Brunatti, López was well connected in Spain, where he arrived to follow the career of Javier Saviola in 2001. Saviola and Topo Lopez remained close friends and he was Ole's correspondent in Barcelona, a newspaper he had worked with since its launch. He had worked as a journalist for two decades, covering River Plate and Argentina for Ole while collaborating with Spanish daily Sport while spending time back in Buenos Aires. In 2010 he became AS's correspondent in Argentina was the journalist closest to Lionel Messi and the many of his team-mates. Lionel Messi also dedicated Argentina’s World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old. ‘Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge “Topo” Lopez,' wrote Messi after their penalties victory against Germany. 'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.' Earlier this month Javier Mascherano devoted the launch of his new book to Lopez, while he and Messi were both pictured holding placards with the message on late last year. So too did legend Diego Maradona. Both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have posed in front of a board during team photographs. FIFA also paid tribute to the journalist, with head of media Delia Fischer saying they 'would like to send our sincerest condolences to the family, colleagues and friends of Argentine journalist, Jorge Lopez'.

            "Cleared: 53-year-old Graeme Finlay, a former naval serviceman . A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.' In his evidence, the defendant recalled how he was travelling alone on the Canary Islands cruise in January last year and felt shunned when he joined two couples – including Mr and Mrs Phillips – for dinner in the restaurant. After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met. Both Finlay and the elderly couple spent the evening drinking separately and enjoying the musical entertainment. According to Finlay they later found themselves in a lift together and he rebuked the couple for their rudeness towards him at dinner. Finlay claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of hot chocolate at him, swore and struck him with his crutch. He told the court: 'I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself, I covered my face with my arms, I didn't want my eye poked out.' Innocent: The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm . Cruise: Finlay went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner (file photo) He described to the court how he swung his arms outwards from his face and felt them connect with Mr Phillips. The 'victims' insisted they had not argued with Finlay or ignored him at dinner and were subjected to a vicious assault as they headed to bed following a relaxing evening. Mrs Phillips briefly lost consciousness when she fell against a wall. In her evidence, she said: 'I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof (she swung a punching motion). 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him 'leave him alone you will kill him.' Finlay was later forced to leave the ship and make his own way home. He was interviewed by police and charged.\n",

            "Police are considering manslaughter charges after a man who was violently shaken as a baby died as a result - two decades later. Liam Dawe, 21, was born a healthy child but suffered serious and on-going health complications ever since he was assaulted as a four week old. He died at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault. Liam Dawe died at Derriford Hospital (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon, in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault . At an inquest into his death in Plymouth, coroner Ian Arrow said: 'On the balance of probability, Mr Dawe's health was compromised (by the assault) and he died earlier than expected.' A senior officer attended the hearing and said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if it happened more than a year before. But Det Con Insp David Elliott said as Mr Dawe's injuries were caused in 1993 before the rules came into force, fresh manslaughter charges could still be brought. The inquest heard that Liam, of Tavistock, Devon, was born an otherwise 'normal, healthy baby with no concerns' in 1993, but was shaken at just four weeks old. Police are considering manslaughter charges after Liam Dawe died two decades after being assaulted as a four week old . As a result of an injury to the brain, Mr Dawe developed severe cerebral palsy, epilepsy and visual impairment as well as learning, feeding and respiratory difficulties. He was admitted to Derriford Hospital on March 4 of last year with jaundice and later died on March 25 after his condition deteriorated following a laparotomy to treat an intra-abdominal sepsis. His GP Dr Jo Coldron said: 'There was no health concern at birth, but at four-weeks-old, Liam suffered from a non-accidental injury that led to learning difficulties, cerebral palsy muscle spasms, scoliosis, epilepsy, an unprotected airway and respiratory difficulties. 'On March 4, Liam was admitted to Derriford Hospital. He was slightly jaundiced but otherwise seemed well. 'He was later admitted to ICU, but there was no clear source for his abdominal sepsis. The 'year and a day rule' stated that an act was presumed not to have caused a person to die if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. The ancient rule, which applied to death and suicide, was abolished under the Law Reform Act 1996 amid medical advances. However, the permission of the Attorney General is still required for any prosecution where it is claimed that the death occurred more than three years after the act, or when the offender has previously been convicted of an offence in connection with the death. 'On March 12, he was discharged by ICU onto the ward where his condition deteriorated before he died on March 25.' DCI Elliott attended the inquest to assess the assault Mr Dawe sustained as a baby to determine its significance in his death. He said: 'The question asked of us was if somebody would be prosecuted for manslaughter. 'The adult who assaulted Liam when he was four weeks old was convicted and sent to prison for 12 months imprisonment. 'Liam was shaken at four weeks old and his injuries resulted in ongoing health problems. 'The assault was a deliberate act and, at the time, the question was whether the adult intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 'In June 1996, there was a law change to the \"Year and a Day\" rule which stated an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. 'However, as the injuries were sustained in January 1993, the rule still stands.' Coroner Ian Arrow concluded the cause of Liam's death was 'intra-abdominal sepsis in an individual with severe cerebral palsy.'\n",

            "A teenager who fell ill with flu four months ago is unable to move her arms and legs and can barely eat or talk. Doctors are still trying to find out what the future holds for 17-year-old Natasha Willard after she was diagnosed with inflammation of the brain when she fell ill while studying for her A-levels in Cwmbran in Wales. Miss Willard's family are unsure how the teenager became ill so suddenly, just four days after she returned her feeling unwell. They are now trying to teach her to walk and talk again. Natasha Willard was studying for her A levels at college when she appeared to get the flu just before Christmas and her condition has worsened, leaving her unable to move her limbs and barely able to speak . Her stepmother Kirsty Willard said: 'The doctors are baffled, they do not know what happened. 'They have given her antibiotics and she is on steroids too. 'We are just left in limbo. The doctors have not said what the future holds; they cannot give us that information.' Natasha has been diagnosed with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Natasha appeared fit and well days before she came home ill, and appeared to quickly go down hill . Mrs Willard said doctors have told them they are unsure whether she will make progress, but have warned the family she is unlikely to fully return to herself. Natasha, from Cwmbran, was studying art and Welsh in the sixth form at Torfaen's Llantarnam School when she fell ill. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include seizures, convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, haemorrhaging, and memory loss. Encephalitis develops in reaction to a viral infection or when the body's own immune system attacks brain tissue. The condition can also be caused by the immune system reacting to a tumour. Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with encephalitis every year. Some people make a full recovery from the condition but others can be left with permanent damage to the brain and complications including memory loss and epilepsy. She came home on December 5 after a night out with friends and went straight to bed. Over the next few days Miss Willard started vomiting and had aches and pains, and her family presumed she had the flu. But on December 9 she collapsed and was mumbling and had to be taken to hospital. The teenager cannot remember the first four weeks of her illness and  was unresponsive for the first three. She was then transferred from University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, to Rookwood Hospital, also in Cardiff, for intensive physiotherapy and speech therapy. 'She can say a few words,' said Mrs Willard. 'She can say \"Hi dad\" and \"Hi Kirsty.\" She can say her own name, and her brothers' names, her sister's name and she can say \"yeah.\"' Mrs Willard said they are having to teach the 17-year-old everything from scratch, as if she is a child again. But, she adds that she has not complained about her condition. Mrs Willard, who works in a bar, said they are worried about the reaction of people when the teenager is discharged from hospital. 'I would hate to think her friends would see her in a wheelchair and abandon her,' she said .

            "Gloucester winger Jonny May is hoping to get over being dropped by England with victory in next month’s Challenge Cup final. After beating Exeter 30-19 in their last-four tie, the Cherry and Whites now face Edinburgh at the Twickenham Stoop on May 1 and could claim their first European trophy since 2006. For May, who was overlooked for the last three rounds of the RBS 6 Nations, it is the ideal stage to boost his World Cup selection chances. Jonny May crosses for a spectacular try during Gloucester's 30-19 victory against Exeter . May shows Exeter No 8 Thomas Waldrom a clean pair of heels during the clash at Kingsholm . ‘It was a tough Six Nations but I still believe in myself,’ he said. ‘It’s nice to have a positive note to end the season on. These are the games you remember for the rest of your life. The final gives us everything to play for. It would be great for everyone at the club to win a trophy.’ May was dropped from Stuart Lancaster's England squad following his poor showing against Italy in round two .\n",

            "Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.\n",

            "Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. \"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN. \"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. \"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. \"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said. \"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. \"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom. \"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\" Klitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can. \"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\" The 39-year-old and his fiancée Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya. \"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said. Klitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\" But after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring. \"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\" Watch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.\n",

            "Foreign GPs now account for 11 per cent of family doctors, new figure show . The number of GPs from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the NHS tries to combat a shortage of staff. Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two-thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the NHS is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22.0 per cent of current GPs gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19.8 per cent in 2004 . But the figure is 71 per cent in Barking and Dagenham, east London, 63 per cent in Medway, Kent, and 58 per cent in North Lincolnshire. The NHS is facing a shortage because many GPs are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The Royal College of GPs estimates that the NHS will need to hire at least 8,000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The NHS employs 40,584 GPs, of whom 8,941 are from overseas. This is up from 6,921 in 2004 when there were 34,855 family doctors in total. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘We need GPs from around the world to support the Health Service, and we simply don’t train enough. ‘We need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.’ The figures do not state where the foreign GPs trained but separate data from the General Medical Council shows many are from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Earlier this year UKIP leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not be working on the NHS as they didn’t speak good enough English . Earlier this year Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not work for the NHS because they lack good English. He said: ‘Don’t we want to live in a country where we speak the same language? And isn’t it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country?’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The NHS – general practice included – is staffed by hardworking healthcare professionals from all over the world. 'We are very grateful for the work that doctors from overseas are doing.’ The NHS should train more staff rather than spending £2.5 billion a year on locum doctors and agency nurses, a think-tank has suggested. A larger pool of dependable permanent staff would also enhance workforce stability and patient safety, the cross-party Civitas said. The subsequent increase in competition for jobs would also help fill less desirable roles such as those in A&E departments and general practice. The think-tank said the typical charge for a consultant from an agency was £1,760 a day, equivalent to a salary of £459,000. Because the salary of an NHS consultant was between £75,249 and £101,451, four consultants could be employed for the price of one agency staff member.\n",

            "The mother of a young woman who suffers from lupus, an inflammatory disease which affects the immune system, has hit back at a stranger who left a cruel note on her daughter’s car claiming she had no right to park in a disabled space – despite the fact that she has a handicap permit. Corinna Skorpenske, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took to Facebook to publicly shame the anonymous note writer, while also defending her daughter Harley Jo, a student at Ohio State University, and her condition. 'My first reaction was anger,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'On top of everything she deals with she didn't need this. Harley is very strong, and many times she just lets it go. But because she is human I know she feels something.' Noted: Harley Jo Skorpenske, who suffers from lupus, discovered this note on her car after stopping at a CVS in Cleveland, Ohio . Keeping up appearances: The disability caused by Harley's illness is not visible to others, but presents her with a battle every day . The harsh note, which was left on Harley’s car, despite the fact that that her official handicap tag was clearly visible, read:  'You should be ashamed! When you take a handicap spot, an actual disabled person suffers. You were not raised as you should have been.' The person who wrote it evidently saw Harley walk into the pharmacy unaided, and assumed that she was lying about being disabled. In response to the note, Harley's mother Corinna wrote an open letter on Facebook, hoping it would eventually reach the person whose ignorance had so upset her daughter, and also aiming to raise awareness for non-visible 'ghost diseases' such as Harley's. Including a photo of the note lying on top of Harley's handicap tag, Corinna wrote in her post: 'To the person who left this on my daughter’s car. You'd never know: Harley may struggle every day, but she continues to persevere, unbeknownst to many of those around her . Mom knows best: Corrina Skorpenske (pictured) hopes to find the writer of the note and change that person's - and others' - perceptions about 'ghost diseases' 'Wishing so much for you to have stopped and talked to this amazing person before leaving this. If you had, you would have known that my daughter has a disease.' Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack its own tissue, leading to inflammation that results in visible swelling and joint pain. The disease affects women much more frequently than men and leaves suffers feeling extremely fatigued . The condition is also typified by a 'butterfly rash' which spreads across the face of many with the illness. There is no cure for lupus, but most of those afflicted are able to live a normal lifespan on medication. Corinna went on to explain in detail the laborious battle her daughter has been through since being diagnosed with lupus aged 16. 'It started with her joints swelling and the pain being so bad she could hardly walk,' Corinna said. 'But she continued going to school and keeping up with her community service.' The teenager went on to suffer a facial rash and hair loss - and had to attend her prom in a wig. She would go on to battle debilitating muscle pain, hearing loss, multiple lung collapses and a month-long stay in the hospital that forced her to postpone her studies. But, incredibly, the young lady always made it back - although 'not at 100 per cent' her mother explained. 'She struggles every day with permanent damage she has had to one side of her body and with hearing loss, but baby she keeps going!' gushed Corinna in the letter. 'I think you would love her': Harley's mother leapt to her daughter's (pictured) defense in an open letter, describing her as a fighter and an 'amazing person' 'I may not be a perfect parent, but I know I did good with her!' Corinna's letter is finished with a plea to the writer of the note, saying she hopes to find him or her: 'Not to tell you how wrong you were in leaving that note...but to give you the opportunity to meet My Girl. I think you would love her [sic].' 'People with ghost illnesses are often labeled as lazy or fakes,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'We never know what burdens people struggle with. Often we are so quick to judge or make assumptions, but if we just take the time to ask them, they are often very willing to educate them on it. Their pain and discomfort is real.'\n",

            "Police are hunting a thief who stole an 86-year old woman's handbag while she prayed at church on Good Friday. The man posed as a member of the congregation of St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester to carry out the crime. As well as taking one bag, he tried to steal the contents of two other elderly women's bags before fleeing. Police have released an e-fit and CCTV footage after a thief stole a pensioner's handbag from a church . The thief sat down in a pew next to the 86-year-old for the Good Friday service earlier this month. After grabbing the bag, he targeted an 82-year-old woman but she was alerted when she heard him rustling in her purse. As he fled the church, the thief tried to snatch the handbag from a third woman, also aged 86. But instinctively the woman pushed the thief away as he tried to pull the bag from her shoulder and he ran off. Police have described the incident on April 3 as 'appalling' and have released an e-fit image of the suspected offender. They are appealing to anyone who recognises him to come forward. The thief is described as being a white man, in his 40s of a medium build and wearing a grey hooded top. The incident happened at St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester on April 3 . Det Con Dave Bennett of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The actions of this underhand and sneaky thief are so shocking that I have no doubt people who live in this area, particularly those who worship at this church, will be very angry. 'He used an important date in the religious calendar and within the sanctity of the church grounds to target elderly women who had simply gone to the church to mark Good Friday.' He added: 'Not only did he pinch one woman's bag, but he also tried to steal two other handbags and was only stopped in his tracks thanks to the vigilance of two of the women. 'It is a sinister, cowardly and disrespectful crime and we need to find the man responsible before he can target anyone else, whether they will elderly people or those attending at the church. 'We have released an accurate likeness of this offender and I would urge people to look very carefully at the image. If you recognise who this man is then please do the right thing and call us. 'Alternatively, I would urge people to be vigilant and if you think you see this man, then please call us straight away.'\n",

            "Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. The SNP demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds - as the latest price of propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street in the event of a hung Parliament. Miss Sturgeon said the rising retirement age was particularly unfair for pensioners in Scotland because they don’t live as long as their counterparts in the rest of the country. Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. She is pictured at the Westerton Care Home during an election campaign visit in Glasgow . The SNP leader demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds . At the same time, she issued a demand for a huge inflation-busting increase in the State pension, which would cost billions of pounds more. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113. Parts of Scotland have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the UK. In central Glasgow it is less than 73 years for men and for women less than 79. Across Scotland the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women. In England and Wales the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women. But various studies have linked lower life expectancy in Scotland to higher rates of alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor diet. It is also linked to levels of poverty and housing. Her comments will raise concerns that the SNP will demand a more expensive pension system across the whole of the UK which will benefit Scotland most. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113 . Speaking on a visit to a care home in East Dunbartonshire, Miss Sturgeon said: ‘The Tory/Lib Dem government’s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the UK who are planning for their future, but the failure to take Scotland’s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair. ‘Our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which I will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in Scotland who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out.’ ‘That is why SNP MPs will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age.’ ‘Our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return. She said the SNP would ensure that ‘the contribution older people have made throughout their lives is recognised’ if they hold the balance of power after the election. Miss Sturgeon also issued a demand for the single tier pension to increase to at least ‘to ensure pensioners are no longer subjected to the scourge of means-tested benefits.’ The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Capping the state pension age in Scotland will cost hardworking taxpayers across Britain more than £12.5 billion. ‘This gives another glimpse into a future with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, in the SNP’s pocket – meaning more borrowing, more spending, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ On Sunday Miss Sturgeon said the SNP would be prepared to prop up a minority Labour government even if Ed Miliband lost the election. She said the party’s MPs would vote to support Labour even if the party won fewer seats than the Conservatives on May 7. The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped. For many years, the UK state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60. But from 2020, both men and women’s retirement age will be 66, increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then linked to life expectancy after that. The government will then review the state pension age every five years. During last year’s referendum campaign, the SNP argued the level should only increase to 66 in Scotland, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less.\n",

            "Two property developers branded 'arrogant and greedy' by a judge have been jailed after a three-storey building collapsed trapping three people in the rubble. A doctor's wife and a student plunged from the living rooms of their flats into the basement below  and a workman was buried after a digger struck a load-bearing column. The accident left three victims hospitalised with minor injuries, while 20 students were left homeless and one of Sheffield's main arterial roads was closed for a day. Most of the students who lived in flats above the development in the Brook Hill area of the South Yorkshire city were luckily out at the time and missed the accident. Jailing brothers Naveed and Rizwan Hussain for 12 months each today, Judge Michael Murphy told them: 'It was only by the grace of God or good fortune that people were not seriously injured or killed. 'If a member of the public had been passing by they would have said \"How on earth was no-one killed in that?\" There was potential for a complete disaster. It was caused by your arrogance and greed.' Before: Students and a doctor and his wife lived above the retail premises in Sheffield until the 2013 incident. Three people were injured and the building's collapse caused the main road to be closed off . After: But the building was left looking like it had been hit by a bomb after botched work by landlords Naveed and Rizwan Hussain, who were jailed for health and safety offences today . Officers from the Health and Safety Executive spent two years and £150,000 investigating the collapse and bringing the defendants to justice for what was called a 'flagrant disregard' of Health and Safety regulations. Sheffield Crown Court heard that neither city landlord Naveed, 33, or Rizwan, 39, had any building experience, qualifications or planning permission for the structural works they were carrying out. Rizwan, who managed the shop in the building, and Naveed, the landlord of the flats above, were hoping to extend and reopen a former Indian restaurant on the site. Nigel Lawrence, prosecuting, said the flats above the retail premises were occupied by Sheffield University students as well as a doctor and his wife. A builder and a structural engineer were consulted over plans to lower the floor level and make the restaurant open-plan but the brothers then dispensed with their services. Although a planning application was submitted, permission had not been grantedwhen construction work on the restaurant started about four weeks before the collapse in March 2013. The student tenants complained about cracks in their walls and noise from drilling and machinery but Rizwan told them the restaurant would be open within four months and he would offer them jobs there. Naveed brought in an excavator and began removing rubble with the help of an odd-job man while Rizwan instructed other workmen. Pillars and internal walls were removed. Firemen had to make the building safe after the wall and upper floors caved in in March 2103 . The work meant a main road in Sheffield was closed off. The section of the building was later demolished . As the work progressed, the doctor confronted Naveed in the basement and was shocked to see the underside of the laminate floor in his flat above supported only by steel beams with large areas of wall removed. 'He asked Naveed if he and his wife should vacate the flat but Naveed assured him this was not necessary,' said Mr Lawrence. A week later student Kishore Chandrasekaran was in his flat when the wall and the floor collapsed, dropping him down onto a pile of rubble in the basement. He was trapped by his right leg but a table which fell on top of him protected him from falling debris. It was half an hour before he managed to struggle free. Doctor's wife Khushboo Shah was sat on the sofa in her lounge. 'She heard a noise like hailstones and the floor beneath her fell away and she fell to the basement together with a section of the building', said Mr Lawrence. She fell on the rubble and was covered in dust as well as being struck by falling pieces of wood. Both the first and second floors of the buildings collapsed and Naveed himself freed the handyman, known only as Mr Raja, from the rubble. The students lost their passports and laptops and their deposits on the flats were not returned. The part-ruined buildings were demolished by Sheffield City Council on safety grounds - with the taxpayer picking up the bill. Before the incident, two storeys of flats sat above the premises the brothers were trying to convert . An independent structural engineer called in to examine the mess said the work was 'inherently dangerous and a serious accident was foreseeable.' Mr Lawrence said: 'It was a miracle that nobody was either killed or seriously injured. It was pure good luck that most of the tenants were out of their homes and no member of the public was nearby.' David Webster for Naveed, a father-of-four who was convicted last year of unlawfully evicting a tenant, said the work was not 'wholly cavalier' from the outset but a measure of cost-cutting overtook prudence. 'The work was done with a highly reckless disregard not only for the safety of others but to my client himself,' he said. 'If there was anybody at the greatest risk it was the one who was in the basement. 'This was hamfisted, clueless, directionless and haphazard rather than calculated maliciousness in bringing down a building. His folly was to think he could turn his hand to this major project without any relevant training or experience.' James Horne, for Rizwan, said his involvement was confined to running the shop in the buildings owned by his father Sabir Hussain. The court heard had no financial interest in the flats and the intention was for the work to be done properly. Now builders are trying to completely re-build the premises after huge disruption caused by the accident . The court heard the father-of-seven had taken out a £488,000 bridging loan on the restaurant project guaranteed by properties belonging to his brother and was currently working as a chef. Naveed and Rizwan both admitted two offences contravening HSE regulations in failing to ensure themselves and their employees were not exposed to risk and failing to take steps to prevent danger to another person. Rizwan also admitted breaching a prohibition notice. As well as being jailed, Naveed was fined £40,000 and Rizwan was given a £42,000 fine. Naveed was ordered to pay £60,000 costs and Rizwan £40,000 costs. Judge Murphy told the brothers that their breaches of the regulations were 'blatant and financially motivated'. He said: 'People were terrified and there was inconvenience to untold numbers of people in Sheffield. The potential for disaster was staring everyone in the face apart from you.'\n",

            "Sally Cox, 39, stopped her son Jed Pearce, 10 (pictured together above), from going on the mosque trip, expressing fears of 'violence and guns' Children as young as eight have been banned by their parents from attending a British mosque as part of a school trip over 'safety' fears, with one mother claiming she 'doesn't want to put her son at risk of being shot'. Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon, as part of an RE trip to learn about different faiths. The schoolchildren, from years three to six, were due to visit the city's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer. However, about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week's school trip after their parents said they  would be exposed to 'violence and guns' and expressed 'grave concerns' about the teaching of Islam. Christine Trevethen, 47, a housewife from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, has stopped her 10-year-old daughter Keira going on the visit. She said: 'We are not the only ones that don't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others haven't been honest enough to do so in the consent form. 'I do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons. I don't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but I am not prepared to go into the reasons why. 'We have now been told our children are going to be excluded from RE lessons as a result, which is a big concern. 'We tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly.' Sally Cox, 39, a self-employed cleaner from Lerryn, Cornwall, has also blocked her son Jed Pearce, 10, from going on the visit. She said: 'I did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns. 'You can see what they are like every day on the news. There was a Muslim bomber in Exeter just a few years ago. 'We were just being honest saying we did not want them to go. 'It is unsafe. I don't want my son being shot. Also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion. 'I don't want them to do that. I want him to be in school learning Maths and English - not being put at risk of being shot. 'They decided to take him out of RE, but I said I am fine with that.' Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon (pictured) as part of an RE trip  but 10 pulled out after parents expressed 'grave concerns' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'We have grave concerns about the children's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day. 'We have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip. This decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs, but one based purely on safety concerns.' The parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly. She said: 'They were made to stand up after assembly. The sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip. 'This is not a decision the children have made, so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful, unacceptable and unprofessional.' However, not all parents are opposed to the trip, with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move. Alice Mitchell, 35, a playworker from Lostwithiel, said: 'I think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate. 'I am all for my children going on the trip. I think celebrating diversity is a great thing. 'It is all down to fear. People are scared of other religions. There is a lot of misconceptions.' And Sian Cornish, 41, a self-employed retailer, from Lostwithiel, added:' 'I did not even realise it was an issue. I was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship. 'I think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you don't agree with them.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of Lostwithiel School (pictured), which has just 156 pupils on its books, said the trip would still take place on May 7 to 'show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam' Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the school, said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they're aware of the diverse nature of modern Britain. 'Because of recent news reports about extremist groups, such as ISIS, that identify themselves with Islam, a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of Islam in school. 'In response, the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues, and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns. 'A full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip.' Ms Smith said the school had a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities. She said: 'Religious Education forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law. Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the Lostwithiel School, said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of Islam at the school . 'The school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from RE in whole or in part, and provide alternative work to further their child's knowledge and understanding of the parents' beliefs and values. 'However, the school is aware that children growing up in Cornwall may have little contact with Muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty. 'The Governing Body fully supports this trip and the teaching of RE, including Islam. 'It is the governors' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of British Islam, help them understand how Islam is presented in the media and that groups like ISIS are not a true reflection of the Islam followed by the vast majority of Muslims in Britain.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11, said the trip would still be taking place on May 7. She said: 'Our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a British Muslim. 'This trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam as a religion.' Exeter Mosque, described as the 'Islamic Centre of the South West', is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the Quran and basics of the Deen. The Mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips. Lostwithiel School, which has around six teachers, said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions. The school said it follows the Cornwall Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education and part of the curriculum encourages children to study Christianity in great detail, as well as finding out about Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam through school trips, visits from outside speakers and class teaching. The Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip. A spokesman said: 'We would have thought a well-rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith. 'These laudable initiatives take place across the country. It is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world. 'We hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against Muslims in this country. 'We commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real Islam and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion.' MailOnline has contacted Exeter Mosque for comment.\n",

            "Kansas is one signature away from telling poor families that it's illegal to use their welfare payments to buy alcohol, tobacco and pornography, to visit strip clubs or tattoo shops, and to take vacation cruises or gamble on dog or horse races. Swimming pools, jewelry and lingerie stores, psychics, movie theatre, nail salons, massage parlors, bars and theme parks will also be forbidden territory for the first time, if Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signs a bill that hit his desk last week. The proposal would also give the force of state law to some of brownback's policies, including one that requires 'temporary cash assistance' recipients to hold down jobs, look for work or enroll in job training programs. NO BENEFITS: A pending Kansas law would make it illegal for welfare recipients to spend their government-supplied stipends at strip clubs, among a laundry list of other places . NO INK: Kansas welfare recipients who want taxpayers to shell out for their tattoos have until July 1 to experiment with the latest in body art . PARTISAN: Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback (center) is likely to sign the new measure despite strong opposition from Democrats . Kansans, like citizens of many other states, are issued debit cards when they register for state-based welfare. Under the rules of the bill passed in the state legislature, bail-bondsmen would no longer be allowed to accept the cards as payment. Recipients would be limited, for the first time, to withdrawing  $25 in cash per day. Liberal lawmakers complained that some welfare recipients use their debit cards to get funds for rent payments. Democratic state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau told the Topeka Capital-Journal that forcing those people to make multiple trips to bank machines to pay their bills 'is ludicrous. It is outrageous.' State Rep. Carolyn Bridges, another Democrat, complained during a legislative debate that putting limits on how the poor can spend taxpayer dollars says to them: 'If you are asking for assistance in this state, you're sort of less than other people and we're going to tell you how and where to spend your money.' NECESSITIES: Tobacco will be added to the no-no list, along with movie tickets, cruise vactions and lingerie . I SEE A JOB IN YOUR FUTURE: Fortune tellers and psychics? Out. Job training? In. CONFLICT: Republican state Rep. Kansas state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (left) insists that getting welfare recipients 'back to work' justifies the new law, while state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau (right) called it 'ludicrous' and 'outrageous' But state Sen. Michael O’Donnell, the Republican who gathered support for a House bill putting all the changes into place, said public assistance should be spent 'more responsibly' than it had been in the past. 'We’re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended' – on food and necessities like diapers or toiletries, O’Donnell told the paper. The Brownback administration has signaled its support for the measure. It has already presided over a 60 per cent drop in the number of Kansans enrolled in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, known as TANF, during his first term in office. When Brownback became governor in 2011, the program served 38,900 people statewide. Today that number has dwindled to 15,500, according to statistics compiled by the Kansas Department for Children and Families. Numbers of food stamp recipients – a completely separate category of government welfare – have ticked down by just 6 per cent during the same period, however. Poverty rates among children have remained constant, according to the social-services nonprofit group Kansas Action for Children . The clash of statistics has raised questions about whether the state has actually been moving people off of TANF and into jobs. VICIOUS CIRCLE? Benefits recipients were previously permitted to spend their government money to bail themselves and family members out of jail . YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK: Until Brownback became governor, welfare enrollees could buy liquor with their benefit debit cards, but now his policy is likely to become a law that future pols will find it hard to undo . 'This is serious, good policy for the state of Kansas,' state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady, a Palco Republican, told the Associated Press. 'There's nothing better to get these people back on their feet than getting them a job and getting them back to work.' But Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly countered in the Capital-Journal that 'we pat ourselves on the back that our TANF rolls have gone down exponentially and we say it’s because all those people are now working,' but 'we don’t know that and I’m guessing its not the truth.' Another Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Barbara Ballard, complained during a debate that telling welfare recipients that they can't use their state benefits to visit swimming pools would give the poor one fewer way to stay healthy. Republicans control both the Kansas House and Senate by wide margins. THe House vote was 87-35, and the Senate passed the bill 30-10. If Brownback signs the bill, it will go into effect in July.\n",

            "All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a £5,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to £140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.\n",

            "Nearly half of the British public believe the Duchess of Cornwall should become Queen Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne. A new poll by YouGov ahead of Charles and Camilla's 10th wedding anniversary reveals that 49 per cent think Camilla should take the traditional title of the wife of a reigning king, while 35 per cent believe she should be given a lesser title out of respect to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were undecided. When the Prince and Camilla became engaged in February 2005, only 7 per cent of people polled by YouGov thought Camilla should one day be Queen. Scroll down for video . Almost half of all Britons believe Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, right, should become Queen when Prince Charles accedes to the throne although 35 per cent believe she should be rewarded with a lesser title . Half of those polled believe that Camilla, right, does a good job of carrying out her official duties . Aides have always insisted the Duchess does not want to be known as Queen and intends to be known as Princess Consort instead. But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become Queen no matter what title she actually uses. Most people (42 per cent) said they had neither a positive or negative impression of Camilla, with 31 per cent saying they had a positive one and 23 per cent a negative one. But the survey of 1,830 people also showed that 44 per cent believed Camilla was well prepared to be the wife of the reigning monarch, 13 per cent thought she was badly prepared and the remainder had no opinion or did not know. Of those questioned, 50 per cent thought Camilla had carried out her duties as Duchess of Cornwall well - with 20 per cent saying she did this very well and 30 per cent fairly well. Only 6 per cent thought she had done badly in the role. Some 28 per cent had no opinion and 16 per cent did not know. Nicola Wildash, research executive at YouGov, suggested it was more a case of people becoming used to Camilla, rather than a large surge in popularity. 'The further we get from Diana's death, the less that will resonate in people's minds. As soon as the public see something for years and years, they become more neutralised to the issue,' she said. Prince Charles, left, and Camilla, right, are preparing to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary . Figures from YouGov in June last year showed 53 per cent thought Camilla should one day become Queen Consort, 32 per cent believed she should have a lesser title and 14 per cent did not know. But Ms Wildash said the slight decrease from 53 per cent to 49 per cent was not significant and part of a general small fluctuation. Almost two fifths (39 per cent) said they believed the Queen was happy with Camilla's performance as the Duchess of Cornwall, with only 9 per cent thinking the monarch was unhappy. Regarding Charles, 29 per cent think he is performing his duties as Prince of Wales better than he did 10 years ago, while 7 per cent think he is performing his duties worse than a decade ago. But 27 per cent think he was already performing his duties well and there has been no difference during the 10 years and 12 per cent believe there is no difference and he is still performing his duties poorly.\n",

            "Sweden’s passport has been named the most powerful in the world, but it turns out it’s also one of the most highly sought-after travel documents on the black market. The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as £6,000 each – far more than the £28 fee that Sweden’s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world’s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium’s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just £9, while Turkey has the most expensive at £166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries – the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US – but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just £28 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn’t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world – behind Sweden, Finland and Germany – with a fee of £73. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's £33 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.\n",

            "Around one in seven couples suffer with infertility and an increasing number are seeking alternative therapies in the hope it will bring them a longed for baby. Those who can afford it can turn to London's famous private medical haven Harley Street, where Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai has been helping women conceive for decades using only traditional Chinese medicine. Now she's invited BBC cameras inside The Zhai Clinic, which she opened in 1996, to reveal the secrets of her success. Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai says she has used Chinese medicine to help a thousand women become pregnant . 'I'm a doctor who initially trained in western medicine, then I studied Chinese medicine as I realised lots of problems couldn't be overcome by traditional western medicine,' she explains to Vanessa Engle for the documentary Inside Harley Street, which airs tonight on BBC2. Dr Zhai's methods include acupuncture and prescribing a bespoke combination of Chinese herbs which must be taken day and night. The herbs may be drunk as a tea or are provided as a vitamin tablet - 12 must be taken in the morning and 12 in the evening. The vitamins contain natural ingredients such goji berries, Chinese yan and ginger. Dr Zhai says as a result of her natural remedies: 'I have brought more than one thousand babies into the world.' One of them was advertising director Jane Parker's son Rupert. He was conceived when she was 40. Dr Zhai prescribes a bespoke course of vitamins - 24 tablets a day for two weeks - containing Chinese herbs to help conception (file photo) Jane, from London, previously told the Mail On Sunday how she fell pregnant using Dr Zhai's methods after two failed cycles of IVF. She said: 'I'd read an article about her, and had arranged it even before I'd had the IVF – she had a long waiting list. I was in an emotional state of shock when I saw her in December 2008. 'I was convinced she was going to tell me I was too old. Yet she was incredibly reassuring, giving me confidence without raising my hopes to unrealistic levels. 'She ran a series of checks including blood tests and scans. She only prescribes after she's been through the results. 'In January 2009, alongside regular acupuncture sessions, I started taking specially prepared herbs, following her advice on which supplements to take and made several changes to my lifestyle (including giving up alcohol, taking no vigorous exercise and avoiding cold drinks). 'One month later, I’d just returned from holiday and realised my period was late. I bought a pregnancy test and discovered I was expecting! I carried on with the acupuncture, herbs and supplements throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'I gave birth to Rupert in November 2009 when I was 41. I genuinely believe that if I hadn’t seen Dr Zhai, I wouldn't have my son.' The new BBC documentary, which airs this evening follows May Lyang, 36, who hopes to have a success story like Jane's after five years of trying. She turned to Dr Zhai after losing a baby she conceived via IVF treatment on the NHS. Jane Parker had her son Rupert in 2009 when she was 41 after having treatment at Dr Zhai's clinic . She said: 'I got pregnant and I carried through for 11 weeks but then I miscarried a month ago. 'I think about it every day but you have to move on so that's why I'm here. You have to take positive steps and not think about what is lost.' May has an initial consultation with Dr Zhai which costs £250 for an hour. During the assessment, Dr Zhai quizzes her on her lifestyle and observes that she doesn't appear to be in the best health because of the appearance of her tongue and her pale complexion. But she tells her she had potential and she's confident she will conceive. May pays £300 a month for tea made from Chinese herbs. Further check-ups with Dr Zhai will cost her £130, while three sessions of acupuncture at the clinic cost £350. After a period taking the Chinese herbal tea, she is then prescribed a mixture of Chinese herbs in a pill form which must be taken 24 times a day (12 in the morning and 12 in the evening) for two weeks, costing around £150. The BBC documentary catches up with May months on from her first appointment with Dr Zhai and while she still hasn't become pregnant, she remains hopeful. She said: 'I've got the clinic on my side, this can happen. It doesn't bother me that I'm not pregnant yet. At my last consultation, Dr Zhai said I'm not ready yet, I need to fix what's inside.' But May adds that if she still doesn't fall pregnant, she will ditch the alternative therapies in favour of IVF on the NHS again. Dr Zhai said acupuncture aids fertility because it 'promotes your body's natural healing response and stimulates natural energy flow' In her book, How To Get Pregnant, Dr Zhai said her methods work for those who can't be helped by IVF. She writes: 'I believe that our success rate is high because most patients who have trouble conceiving are not suffering from mechanical problems such as blocked fallopian tubes (these can be fixed by surgery or bypassed using IVF). Goji berries are one of the ingredients that may be found in Dr Zhai's fertility boosting vitamins . 'The most common causes of IVF failure are poor sperm production, poor quality eggs, malfunction of the ovaries or the blood supply with the abdomen not being healthy enough. 'Couples who find it difficult to conceive have problems that can often be helped by kick-starting the reproductive system, improving sperm quality and quantity and improving the menstrual cycle.' She said the herbal medicine, combined with a change to a healthy diet and light exercise, can work because: 'Herbal medicine has powerful healing properties which work on the internal organs and the reproductive system. 'It aims to clear obstruction, rectifies the balance between yin and yang in the organs and helps to restore normal bodily functions.' She also claimed: 'Most importantly, herbs have proved capable of reducing chromosomal abnormality in male sperm and female eggs so improving quality of both.' When it comes to another of her recommended treatments - acupuncture - she writes on her website: 'Acupuncture is believed to work by promoting your body's natural healing response and stimulating and balancing natural energy flow (known as Qi or chi). The BBC documentary Inside Harley Street also looks at other alternative therapies on offer for various ailments. 'Leech therapist' Maryam Rahbari, pictured, says the worms can work wonders for the health . 'Practitioners are trained to understand that the network of the energy pathway (known as meridians) that connect the organs of the body. 'When one of these pathways becomes blocked or malfunctions, problems such as pain, illness or disease may result. 'By stimulating the specific acupuncture points, TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] practitioners are trained to clear blockages in the body's meridian system, with the aim of restoring balance in the body.' Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin and is an ancient Chinese treatment that is being embraced more widely in the west for problems such as stress and back pain. It has not yet been  proven to help women conceive but it is thought to increase the chances - possibly because it makes a woman more relaxed. As well as looking at alternative therapies for infertility on Harley Street, tonight's documentary also looks at the other unusual treatments - such as applying leeches to the skin to relieve pain - that people are turning to when traditional western medicine hasn't helped them. Inside Harley Street: Make Me Well is on BBC2 at 9pm .\n",

            "The 20-year-old deranged pizza delivery driver on trial for stabbing and strangling his roommate to death before having sex with her corpse was found guilty of first-degree murder on Thursday and sentenced to two life terms in prison. The Florida court heard  how Bryan Santana was living out some kind of sick fantasy when he removed all the lightbulbs of the Orlando home he shared with Shelby Fazio, 23, before waiting for the young woman to return, killing her and then abusing her body in October last year. Jurors were told Santana first choked Fazio in a headlock before wrapping a belt around her neck and stabbing her with a hunting knife. He then killed and mutilated her dog, and wrote messages in blood on the wall, including: ''I'm not sorry for what I did.' The panel took just two hours to deliberate on Thursday, and Fazio's family cried in their seats as the verdict was handed down. Maniac: Bryan Santana, 20, of Orlando, Florida, was found guilty of the the cold-blooded murder of his roommate, Shelby Fazio, 23, on Thursday. He was sentenced to life terms in prison . In court: The trial in Orlando lasted just three days, with Santana previously admitted to murdering the victim and raping her corpse, with the jury deliberating for two hours . Overcome: Family members of the victim, Shelby Fazio, weep as her killer is found guilty on Thursday . 'This is endless': Afterwards the family said they will 'never escape' the death of the young woman, who was murdered by her roommate, Bryan Santana . 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will': Judge Renee Roche was scathing in her closing statements, saying Santana 'no glimmer of humanity' Judge Renee Roche said Santana has 'no glimmer of humanity', according to WFTV. 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will,' Judge Roche said. 'Even her beloved dog will be remembered longer than the defendant.' Cindy Fazio, the victim's mother, said they will never properly deal with her death. 'No more pleasures in life. Each day is just another we don't have with Shelby. No more good days, only days we get through,' said Fazio's mother, Cindy Fazio. She called Santana a 'violent coward.' The victim's father, Terry Fazio, added: 'This is endless. We'll never escape. Hope you get it as bad as you did to Shelby.' Roche gave Santana two life sentences for the murder of Fazio and attempted murder of his second roommate. He was also found guilty of cruelty to animals, abuse of a dead human body and two counts of grand theft. Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida murdered his roommate Shelby Fazio (right) in October and sexually abused her dead body. He then killed her dog, stole their other roommates car, and went to get a haircut . Santana was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above), and using its blood to write messages on the wall . Prosecutors said Santana 'delighted' in the pain he allegedly caused the young woman. 'He delights in every moment of telling explicitly what he had done to Shelby,' Assistant State Attorney Mark Interlicchio told jurors during opening statements on Wednesday. The Orlando Sentinel reported Santana even messaged a friend and forewarned what was to come, claiming he was going to 'gut' someone, and then saying; 'I have zero money to pay my $400 rent so I'm going to do what I want. I will fulfill my deepest desires.' Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Murphy took to the stand on Wednesday, describing the grizzly scene he discovered when he arrived at the residence Fazio and Santana shared. 'I noticed a body laying on the ground, the door hit the left leg of the body,' he said. 'She was naked. I remember she had a belt around her throat and some type of pen or pencil shoved into her neck.' This came just days after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse during opening statements in the case. 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall,' said Judge Renee Roche after the incident, according to WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she allowed two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He also claimed he has multiple personalities, including one named 'Michael.' In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse . Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed him and came at him with a knife. 'He came at me, pepper sprayed me, I tried to knock the knife out of his hand and was successful in doing that,' said John Heermance. 'And then we wrestled in the living room area.' Heermance then testified on Wednesday that at this point Santana told him to go into his room and everything would be fine. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead if he pointed it at police, a jury heard. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live. Laura Ramirez, a friend of Santana, said on the stand: 'He just said he was going to fulfill his fantasies.' She then added: 'He said he was going to gut her.'\n",

            "Andy Murray tied the knot with Kim Sears on Saturday at Dunblane Cathedral, as thousands of fans waited outside to greet the couple. The tennis star, who announced his engagement in November last year, tied the knot in the 12th century cathedral before a relatively small group of their family members and close friends. Reverend Colin Renwick, led the service, was pictured outside the cathedral just after 3.00pm this afternoon with the wedding taking place at around 4.00pm. Andy Murray and his wife Kim are all smiles after tying the knot at Dunblane Cathedral . Kim shows her delight after marrying British tennis star Murray on Saturday afternoon . The happy couple are covered in confetti as they make their way out of the wedding ceremony . Murray waves to his fans after making his way out of the cathedral following his wedding . Hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the streets around the cathedral and one of the biggest cheer so far has been reserved for Judy Murray, who arrived just before 4.00pm looking resplendent in a white, to-the-knee overcoat with a detailed gold dress.The outfit was topped off with a dramatic gold hat. This morning, the historic cathedral saw florists toting huge bouquets of flowers arrive to decorate the church - as hailstones and showers battered the venue. Clearly unable to contain his excitement this morning, tennis ace Murray posted a tweet to his 2.98 million followers which shows his plans for the day - through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep. Murray (left) and his brother Jamie Murray (second left) arrive for his wedding to Kim Sears . Murray waves to the crowd as he arrives for the wedding as does his mother Judy in Dunblane . Kim Sears arrives for her wedding to British tennis number one Andy at Dunblane Cathedral . Andy tweeted his plans for the day through the use of emojis and it would appear he's counting on plenty of laughter, kissing and alcohol . People continue to gather outside Dunblane Cathedral just hours before the wedding is due to start at 4.30pm . The forecast for the rest of the day isn't on the couple's side although there looks like being some respite from the rain between 3pm and 4pm as guests are expected to arrive. The heavens are likely to open again around 5pm. Andy's mother Judy discussed the bad weather on social media, initially tweeting: 'Hailstones. Marvellous,' and then a few hours later: 'Snowing. White wedding.' Fans who have set up camp outside the church have found themselves battling the elements this morning as they were battered by wind, rain and sleet in short succession. Ross Hutchins (left) was a guest at the ceremony, as was former British No 1 Tim Henman and his wife . However the wet weather showed no sign of dampening the spirits of the crowds outside the cathedral. Brenda Watson travelled from Ochiltree in Ayrshire with her friend to join in the celebrations. She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.' Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.' No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim Sears . Hundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe. Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night. Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for £1.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim Sears . Florists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years. The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe. Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret. Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear. Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral. The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship. Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon. He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November. Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the wedding . Murray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.' Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal. Bride-to-be Kim, 27, wore skinny black jeans, a leather jacket and blue scarf as the final preparations were made for their big day. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers . Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well . Graham Fleming puts up bunting in Dunblane's high street as shops  decorate their fronts in support of local boy Andy . Perhaps saving her legs for walking in heels tomorrow, she today stayed casual in red flats. Meanwhile, a smiling Andy was equally casual in jeans and trainers as he made his way into the cathedral where he will make his vows this weekend. With an Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon title under his belt, Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well. The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have in recent times to a royal wedding'. Reverend Colin Renwick said he expects Britain's top tennis star and his fiancee, Kim Sears, will be as 'nervous and as excited as any couple getting married'. The minister, who has been tight-lipped in recent weeks, said he was 'excited' to be part of the service, as final touches were added to the venue.

            "Want to know what Australians get up to when the lights go out? One in five admit to doing a spot of online shopping in bed at night, according to a new study. The nocturnal shopping sprees are likely down to the 86 per cent of those surveyed who admit to turning to online retailers to purchase items that they are too embarrassed to buy in stores. The things considered too awkward for first person purchases include underwear, hair removal cream, personal hygiene products,  medication... and action figures. Nocturnal shopping spree: One in five Australians shop online at night in bed, while 86 per cent to going online for items they're too embarrassed to buy in store . And this is the least of stealthy shopper habits. The study, released by the StarTrack Online Retail Industry Awards,  found work will often take a back seat when online shopping is only a click away. More than 27 per cent of Australians confess to shopping online at work and 3 per cent even took a sick day  to be able to sign for online orders when they arrived at home. These cunning capers even extend into the offline world, with 24 per cent of shoppers confessing to trying an item on in-store with the intention of buying it online later. Confessions of a shopaholic: 13 per cent of those surveyed admit to online shopping three to four times per day . Shoppers were also found to great covert lengths to keep online shopping habits a secret from their partner, friends or  boss. With  savvy shopping skills at play, it's no surprise then that Australians admit they are online addicts. Of those surveyed, most admitted to shopping up to twice a day and 13 per cent will click through online stores three to four times a day (equivalent to 4.6 hours a week). So how much are we spending? Three-quarters of Australians will spend up to $300 per month or at least $3,600 per year, according to StarTrack. Read below to find out which type you are... 1. THE SNEAKY SHOPPER . 2. THE BLUSHING BUYER . 3. THE ADDICT . 4. THE COVERT CONSUMER . 5. THE BIG SPENDER . This old thing? Covert consumers go to great lengths to hide purchases from partners, friends and family . Pairing this alongside a recent Commonwealth Bank survey that found six million Australians were estimated to  shop online at Christmas alone, it seems online is our new go-to shopping choice. 'The relationship we have with our favourite online stores is personal and is at times extremely intimate,' Executive Chairman of the National Online Retailers Association Paul Greenberg said. 'They are co-conspirators and confidants for many of our secret shopping behaviours. Behind the safety of a screen we can be ourselves, so it's no wonder the number of Australians shopping online is continuing to grow year on year. 'To celebrate that special, unspoken bond between customers and online stores, we're asking people to wear their heart on their sleeve and vote this month for their favourite Australian online retailer in the StarTrack ORIAS People's Choice Awards.'\n",

The Hull midfielder was shown a straight red for the hefty challenge that left Naughton in hospital at the weekend, though neither Garry Monk nor Steve Bruce condemned Meyler at the time. A scan on Monday revealed Naughton suffered ligament damage and the right-back will face a six-week lay-off.

            "Anthony Joshua stopped experienced American Jason Gavern in the third round on Saturday night, but still wasn't happy with his performance. Gavern, in his 50th fight, was dropped twice in the second round and twice more in the third before the contest was waved off in Newcastle. But Joshua, who was returning from a five-month lay-off after suffering a stress fracture in his back, admitted he was not at his best. Anthony Joshua lands a left hand on Jason Gavern on his way to another convincing victory . Joshua dropped Gavern twice in the second round and twice in the third on his way to victory . 'I had a bit of ring rust so couldn’t display everything I have been doing in the gym,' he said after his 11th professional victory. 'But once the momentum gets going I will be able to display some more shots, some more sharp shooting. 'I have boxed in Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, London and I have to say Newcastle is right up there with the crowd, so a big thank you to the fans tonight. 'There are a lot of expectations and Jason is a very awkward opponent. He’s a slippery customer and he is there to make me look back and he did a good job of that. 'I have a job to do and that is get a win. If I can start pushing to British titles, European titles step by step these fights won’t really mean anything when I am experienced and a champion.' Joshua jolted his opponent with a left hook in the opening round although Gavern showed all his experience in frustrating his younger foe. Joshua experienced few problems on his way to another routine victory in Newcastle . Joshua stands over the fallen Gavern as he boxed in front of the Newcastle crowd for the first time . Gavern did hit the canvas midway through the second after a short straight left although the 37-year-old complained he had taken a blow to the back of his head. He was on the canvas again after a brutal right hand followed by another left found its mark, but Gavern got up and defiantly raised his right hand. He was merely delaying the inevitable, though, and a flurry early in the third had him down once more before Joshua finished the job with yet another punishing left, as Gavern was this time unable to beat the count. Joshua will now face the toughest test of his career when he takes on Kevin Johnson next month. 'Johnson has same type of style as Jason; he was a defensive puzzle to unfold but I slowly broke him down and same with Kevin Johnson,' he added. 'There are two sides to a fight, the first six and the second six. One way or another they will get broken down whether it is in the first half or second half.' Gavern was fighting for the 50th time as a professional but his experience counted for little .\n",

            "(CNN)Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.\n",

            "These shocking photographs reveal the terrible toll the Nepal earthquake has had on some of the country's most beautiful and historic landmarks. The monuments of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, are recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of their unique architecture. But several of the most recognisable buildings in the city, including towers and temples, now lie in rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country yesterday morning. Scroll down for videos . Destruction: The Dharahara Tower, which was first built in 1832, has been almost completely obliterated by Nepal's earthquake . Historic: The now-destroyed tower was a UNESCO World Heritage Site until its destruction this weekend . Before: The Kathmandu Durbar Square, at the heart of Nepal's capital, is full of temples and historic houses with their distinctive roofs . After: The square is now piled with rubble after tall temples were brought down by the force of the earthquake . More than 2,500 people died in the quake as buildings collapsed raining down debris on the streets below, while enormous avalanches on Mount Everest left climbers dead. One of the most prominent landmarks to be destroyed by the earthquake was the Dharahara Tower, also known at the Bhimsen Tower, which has almost totally collapsed after more than 180 years of standing in Kathmandu. The 200ft tower was built in 1832 by prime minister Bhimsen Thapa as a gift to the queen, who was also his niece. It had to be rebuilt after a previous earthquake in 1934, but the latest disaster has left the tower as nothing more than a stump, killing scores of people who were trapped inside at the time. Destination: Another view of the Kathmandu Durbar Square shows how it was a thriving hub for the city . Reconstruction: Policemen were sent in to the square after it was badly affected by the quake . Venerable: The Durbar High School in the square is a neo-classical building which was shabby but grand before the earthquake . Debris: The school is now surrounded by bricks shaken from the building in the quake . Heritage: The Bhaktapur Durbar Square, pictured before the quake, is another one of the three main public spaces in the Kathmandu area . Piles: The square in Bhaktapur has rubble heaped up after its ancient temples were damaged . Kathmandu's three 'Durbar Squares', the courtyards outside the city's old royal palaces, were devastated by the earthquake, with historic temples razed to the ground by the shocks. In the largest, known as the Kathmandu Durbar Square, rubble was piled up today after a large stepped temple was obliterated in the quake. Images of the Durbar Squares in Patan and Bhaktapur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, were also devastated by the shocks. The streets of Bhaktapur were impassable because of the rubble which lay several feet deep, with fragments of religious sculptures among the stonework on the ground. In Patan, a temple had its tower broken in half, while the square was strewn with bricks. Centre: The Patan Durbar Square, pictured before the disaster, is the third major hub of the historic royal family which has been devastated . Shock: Religious sculptures were lying on the ground in Patan after the temples they were once part of collapsed . Decapitated: A statue of the Hindu deity Garud was knocked off its pedestal at Patan Durbar Square . Crooked: The stupa of a temple was almost completely ripped off by the force of the quake . Holy: The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the monkey temple, is pictured left before and right after the quake . Witness: A monk surveys the aftermath of the quake, which left the main building untouched . The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the 'monkey temple' which stands on a hill above the capital, also suffered severe damage. While the complex's main golden tower was thankfully untouched, many other temple buildings were totally destroyed. The Buddhist site dates back 1,500 years, and is considered one of the holiest places in the world for residents of neighbouring Tibet. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck just before midday yesterday, sending tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and the nearby city of Pokhara. Busy: The packed streets of Kathmandu pictured as they were before the disaster . Damage: A huge crack opened in the middle of the highway after the earthquake . The majority of fatalities were reported in Nepal, with deaths also being confirmed in India, Tibet, Bangladesh and the Nepal-China border. About an hour after the initial quake, a magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit and smaller aftershocks could be felt through the region for hours. Rescuers are still battling to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble, while climbers on Everest are waiting to be rescued by helicopter.\n",

            "The Great Dying, which struck the Earth 252 million years ago, wiped out more than 96 per cent of the world's creatures. And while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event, research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic. In particular, they claim the volcanic eruptions released huge amounts of carbon dioxide which were absorbed into the oceans and changed their chemical compositions. The Great Dying, which struck the Earth 252 million years ago, wiped out more than 96% of the world's creatures. And while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event, research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic . The study, led by the University of Edinburgh, is the first to show that highly acidic oceans were to blame. And the researchers said that the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere to trigger the mass extinction was 'probably greater than today's fossil fuel reserves'. The Great Dying, also known as the Permian-Triassic Boundary extinction, took place over a 60,000-year period, and acidification of the oceans lasted for around 10,000 years. At this time, a single supercontinent called Pangaea covered the Earth. This huge landmass created extremely arid conditions and by the Late Permian, temperatures were at an all time high. These extreme temperatures already threatened many land and marine species, but this was made worse when large volcanic eruptions began to take place. Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth.

Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Researchers believe this acidification  lasted for around 10,000 years. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Oceans can absorb some carbon dioxide, but the large volume released - at such a fast rate - changed their chemistry. To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates (pictured) - which were on the ocean floor at the time of the extinction. From this they developed a climate model because the rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions . Similar analysis in Italy found evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks. The rocks were found to contain vanillin (shown) which is usually broken down by bacteria. This proved acid in the rocks protected the vanillin, as its low pH deactivated the destructive enzymes . To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates - which were on the ocean floor at the time - to develop a climate model to work out what drove the extinction. A huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction, based on the examination of grains of 'shocked quartz' and meteorite fragments in Antarctica, but no impact site has been found. One of the attractions of the theory is that it could have triggered other causes such as the Siberian Traps eruptions. Widespread ocean anoxia - a severe deficiency of oxygen - has also been blamed for the event in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. The spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia - the presence of hydrogen sulphide - would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide, which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism. The rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions at the time. 'Scientists have long suspected that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass extinction of all time, but direct evidence has been lacking until now,' said Dr Clarkson from the University of Edinburgh's school of geosciences. 'This is a worrying finding, considering that we can already see an increase in ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions.' The study is published in the journal Science and was carried out in collaboration with the University of Bremen, University of Exeter and the Universities of Graz, Leeds, and Cambridge. And the findings are now helping scientists understand the threat posed to marine life by modern-day ocean acidification. Dr Clarkson's research follows similar analysis  in Italy earlier this year by geologists from Imperial College London (ICL). They discovered evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks from Italy's Vigo Meano region. 'For the first time, we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar,' Mark Sephton from ICL said. The Vigo Meano rocks contained vanillin - the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour - and this was a surprise because vanillin is typically broken down by bacteria. In an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long, the researchers turned to the dairy industry, which sometimes uses vanilla in milk. Scientists recently used satellite data to map the alkalinity of the world's oceans for the first time. The image above shows the average level of alkalinity over the past five years with blue marking water that is more acidic. By using satellite data, scientists can obtain live information as the ocean changes . Acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low pH deactivates the enzymes that would break it down. The same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock. 'Our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning,' said Henk Visscher, a palaeoecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The findings follow a similar study in 2013 by US scientists who simulated the Great Dying. The MIT researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain, which would have affected plant growth. They believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth, contributing to their ultimate extinction. After the eruptions ended, the researchers found believe pH levels in rain bounced back, becoming less acidic within one year. Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 to 88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, although it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 to 87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.\n",

The strange-looking baby opens all ten lips when he is sucking at his mother's udders. But he can only take in milk through two of his mouths. He is being fed three times a day at the dairy farm where he was born, in Narnaul, northern India. Scroll down for video . On everyone's lips: This calf in northern India has five mouths and is attracting a stream of human visitors . Normal body: From the neck down the baby, who has been called Nandi, looks like any other calf . Dinner time: Nandi sucks from his mother's udders with one of his mouths. She feeds him three times a day . Shocked locals have called the calf Nandi - a nickname for Lord Krishna. It can also mean 'one who pleases others'. In India's Hindu culture, cows are revered as a symbol of life. Nandi is attracting a constant stream of visitors wanting to celebrate him. Many of them kneel before him to pray and touch his hooves. Local vet Sukhbir Singh said that despite Nandi's appearance, he is healthy and thriving. But the calf's two eyes are positioned in such a way on his distorted head that he can only see to his sides and can't look in front of him. One eye is blue and the other black. Other strange-looking bovine have been recorded in recent years, including a buffalo with three mouths and three eyes that was in in 2009, also in northern India, in 2009. Last month a bull with two faces - one on top the other - was sold to an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. The 440kg animal fetched around £300 in the auction at Mareeba Livestock Yard. Celebrating him: Local schoolchildren kneel and pray at Nandi's feet. Cows are revered in the Hindu faith . Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too.

            "Dion Dublin made his presenting debut on Monday morning as the former footballer co-hosted BBC television show Homes Under The Hammer. The former Aston Villa frontman joined regular hosts Martin Roberts and Lucy Alexander for the popular property renovation series as he looked to help a brother and sister-in-law put some life into a three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford. 'Great to be here. And as you know property can be incredibly rewarding but can throw up some unexpected surprises and we've seen many of those on Home under the Hammer,' said Dublin following his introduction. Dion Dublin made his Home Under The Hammer debut as a co-host on Monday morning . The former footballer seemed to be in his element as he discusses property renovation . Homes Under the Hammer airs weekdays on BBC1 at 10am. Hosts Lucy, Martin and Dion follow house buyers from the auction room, through the troublesome process of renovating the houses they have bought. The presenters meet the buyers and make suggestions on how best to improve the property. But, ultimately, let the buyers make their own decisions. Later, they return to the property to meet the buyers and find out how improvement works have progressed. Finally a selection of local estate agents visit the property, value it and the buyers discover if they have made themselves a profit. The 45-year-old certainly seemed to know his stuff as he pointed the way around the run-down property and was brimming with ideas for first-time property developers Mike and Lucia. 'The kitchen needs an overhaul. It's all a bit 80s and needs a refurbishment. 'You could knock through the dividing wall and give yourself a kitchen diner,' expressed the retired striker as he crouched down inside the lounge. 'You could even put this wall back in to give yourself a separate lounge and you could put a table and chairs in here. I can watch the football in here and be undisturbed.' Mike and Lucia bought the Dartford property at auction for £215,000 and gave themselves a budget of just £10,000 with an original plan to replace the windows and doors. Dublin talks with first time property developers Mike and Lucia, who had purchased the semi-detached house . A before shot of the three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford . Mike and Lucia bought the property for £215,000 and hoped to sell it on for close to £270,000 . Unfortunately the semi-detached house needed more work than originally thought as Mike revealed the pair had to spend between £25,000 and £35,000 leaving them with a total spend of £245,000. 'Oh dear,' said Dublin, before claiming the pair had made the right decision and could be set for a profit of around £25,000 if the property is re-sold for it's new estimated value of between £260,000 and £280,000. Dublin - who has a long-held interest in the property market from his football career- received plenty of plaudits from viewers via social media including high praise from IBF World Super Bantamweight champion Carl Frampton.

            "China have said they are to start tracking the actions of their citizens abroad, following a string of reports about behaviour abroad. The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) said on its website on Monday that provincial and national authorities will be in touch with unruly citizens when they return to China, and if necessary, the police, customs officers, border control and even bank credit agencies will be contacted. They are hoping the strict measures will encourage Chinese tourists from doing anything inappropriate or illegal while abroad. Big spenders: Shoppers from China and the Far East scramble for bargains during the Christmas sales at Selfridges in London's Oxford Street. Chinese travellers spent an incredible $164 billion on foreign trips last year . Horrific! A group of Chinese travellers who scalded a flight attendant with hot water and noodles and threatened to blow up a plane. The passengers lashed out at cabin crew after they became enraged over sitting arrangements on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing . According to China People's Daily, bad behaviour will include: disorder on public transportation－including flights－damaging public facilities or historical relics, ignoring social customs at tourism destinations, and becoming involved with gambling or prostitution. Research by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that there were 109 million Chinese tourists in 2014, who spent $164 billion. These figures are a dramatic increase from the 10 million outbound tourists in 2000, and reflected the rise in numbers of reports on disruptive behaviour. It has been suggested that higher incomes have attributed to more Chinese citizens opting to spend their holidays outside of their country. The CNTA administration said in a separate post: 'tourism reflects on the country and the people's image,' and more 'social supervision' of tourists is needed. In December a brawl started on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong over a woman's crying baby . A Chinese holidaymaker has been hit with a fine for washing her feet in a public bathroom on one of Thailand?s picturesque tourist islands. The woman was spotted washing her feet in a sink less than 30 minutes after island officials posted a no foot washing sign . Over the last few years, a number of embarrassing incidents have helped to tarnish the worldwide reputation of Chinese tourists. In December 2014 a group of Chinese travellers scalded an air stewardess with hot water and noodles and then threatened to blow up the plane, after they were told they could not sit together. It is hoped stricter measures will deter future misdemeanours abroad.

            "Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said \"it was just a rash\", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals \"my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness\". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, \"you're fat, you're ugly\", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said \"it was just a rash\". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how \"I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her\". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .\n",

            "Adam Leheup, 34, was cleared of rape and sexual assault by a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court . An architect who was wooing 35 woman online was cleared today of raping a blind date hours after they met. Adam Leheup, 34, had denied forcing himself on the 25-year-old telling the jury the woman 'freaked out' when he tried to comfort her about her saggy breasts. During the week long trial the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Leheup ignored her cries of 'no' and afterwards said: 'In my experience girls say no, but they don't mean it'. But following their deliberations a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court found the University of Greenwich graduate, a technical co-ordinator on the £500million Nine Elms Point Development not guilty of rape and sexual assault. The self-confessed first date addict had spent nearly a year on police bail before eventually being charged and appeared emotional, emitting a slight gasp, as he was cleared. Leheup told the jury they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. ‘I noticed she had unusually saggy breasts, she seemed uncomfortable about that,' he told the jury. 'I tried to comfort her by kissing and touching them, then she freaked out.’ He had fought back tears as he told jurors he never had sex with the young woman and didn't do anything she did not consent to. Leheup of Hersham, Surrey, revealed he was communicating with thirty-five woman at the time and regularly having sex with six of them, but stopped short with the complainant. 'She said: 'Stop' once and I turned to my side and started to go to sleep,' he told the jury. 'When girls have said nothing is going to happen, I've ended up having sex with them,' he added. The pair had met her just hours earlier on  July 9, 2013, after the pair chatted on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Leheup ended up returning to the woman's flat in the early hours of the morning after he missed his last train home. 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked,' the complainant told police, the court had heard. 'He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: 'No' a lot, but he was not listening. Leheup appeared emotional after he was cleared of the charges following a week long trial at Blackfriars Crown Court . 'I was saying: 'No', but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: 'Girl's say: 'No', but they don't mean it.' I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Parkour and free-running fan, Leheup was arrested after he left the woman's flat. When questioned by police the architect said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. Leheup walked free from court after the jury returned the not guilty verdicts.\n",

            "A teenage boy who shot and killed a teacher and wounded several others in an attack inside a school in Barcelona had a 'hit list', local media reports. The 13-year-old boy is said to have listed 25 names of teachers and pupils he intended to kill and had told classmates of his plans as recent as last week, but none had taken him seriously. The teenager reportedly walked into the school armed with a machete and crossbow around 9.15am this morning, killing a male teacher and injuring two students and two teachers. Scroll down for video . Distressed relatives of students wait outside the Barcelona high school where a 13-year-old boy allegedly shot and killed a teacher using a crossbow, and injuring four people . Students reunite with their families as others wait for news outside the high school in Barcelona as it is claimed that the teenage attacker had told classmates he was planning to 'kill all the teachers' Two young girls comfort each other as students and staff were allowed to leave the school this afternoon . The teenager is said to have launched the attack in his own classroom, targeting his female Catalan teacher and her daughter, also a student at the school, Spanish media reports. According to a witness, the boy had been late for class and shot and injured the female teacher in the face, before stabbing her 13-year-old daughter. Student Gemma Jarque said she and her classmates barricaded themselves into their classroom when they heard the attack. 'We were just starting the class and suddenly we heard screams... so we shut ourselves inside our classroom in order to be safe', she said. 'We saw the teacher lying on the floor in a pool of blood.' Another student, Paula Amayuelas, said the boy had been bullied before in school. She said he 'didn't have problems but he was kind of a loner .... Other students would pick on him.' The boy is undergoing a psychiatric examination will not face criminal charges because he is under 14, the age of criminal responsibility in Spain. The victim, a male substitute teacher, had come to the aid of the woman and her daughter after hearing their screams and was shot and killed as he attempted to protect them, El Pais reports. The week before the attack, the teen had told classmates 'several times', that he was going to kill all the teachers before committing suicide, but none took him seriously and wrote it off as a bad joke. The boy, only identified by his initials M.P.C., had also said it would be easy to carry out an attack in the school with 'good weapons.' Judicial staff members take out the body of a teacher allegedly killed by a student armed with a crossbow at the Instituto Joan Foster  in Barcelona, Spain .

Aftermath: Students and parents leave the Joan Fuster Institute in a bus in Barcelona while police hold the suspect in the school . Following his detention after the slaughter, the boy was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric examination, said Jose Miguel Company, a spokesman for the Barcelona prosecutor's office. 'He was very disturbed and saying strange and incoherent things,' said Company, who added that the examination is aimed at determining whether the boy has psychiatric problems or whether he was faking them. The knife and crossbow used in the attack are believed to belong to the boy's father, who is reported to have kept a collection of weapons at home. His sister, also a pupil at the school, is reported to have fainted when she discovered what had happened. A friend of the sister of the alleged killer, who has not been named, said: 'She is a lovely person but he did strange things.' The female teacher attacked only suffered superficial wounds and her daughter is being treated in hospital with minor injuries. Another victim, a 14-year-old boy, was stabbed in the chest, but is now in stable condition in hospital, El Pais reports. Barcelona police said the boy has been arrested but would not confirm the weapon used in the attack. The attack took place in the Sant Andreu neighborhood of the city just after 9am, and the boy was detained shortly afterwards. The regional Mosses d'Esquadra police force are understood to be holding him at his school this morning on the orders of a judge so he could be examined by experts. Attack: The 13-year-old boy reportedly burst into the school armed with a knife and crossbow, killing a male teacher and injuring four others . Shocking: The attack took place just after 9am this morning and police confirmed the boy has been detained .

The school caretaker is understood to have wrestled him to the ground and disarmed him. Mossos d'Esquadra said in a statement: 'We have identified a minor on suspicion of the death of a teacher at a school in Barcelona. 'The incident happened inside the school about 9.15am when the minor allegedly attacked the teacher with a sharp object. 'During the incident four people were slightly injured, two female teachers and two pupils. 'Three of them have been transferred to hospital and one of them, a female teacher, was treated at the scene. Police are investigating the incident.' The attack took place on the 16th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre when seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students and one teacher. The 1999 massacre in Columbine, Colorado, is the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history.

            "Midsomer Murders is to have its first regular Asian character in its 18th series, four years after the drama's producer said the programme 'wouldn't work' with ethnic minority characters. Manjinder Virk will play pathologist Dr Kam Karimore in the ITV police drama. Although there have been Asian actors in cameo parts, this is the first significant role for an ethnic minority actor. In 2011, executive producer Brian True-May described the show as the 'last bastion of Englishness' because it had no black or Asian characters. Gwilym Lee, Manjinder Virk and Neil Dudgeon (pictured left to right) will star in the upcoming season of Midsomer Murders . He said the show 'wouldn't work' if there was racial diversity among its cast. Mr True-May was suspended as a result of his comments and he later quit. The long-running crime drama is set in the quiet countryside village of Midsomer where DCI John Barnaby investigates a string of murders. Executive producer Jo Wright said Dr Karimore will cause DS Nelson, played by Gwilym Lee, 'trouble in more ways than one.' Midsomer Murders began in 1997 and is watched by more than 6million viewers a week. True-May said at the time the programme just doesn't 'have ethnic minorities involved. Because it wouldn't be the English village with them. It just wouldn't work. Executive producer Brian True-May (left) described the show as the 'last bastion of Englishness' in 2011 because it had no black or Asian characters, pictured with John Nettles . 'Suddenly we might be in Slough. Ironically, Causton (one of the main centres of population in the show) is supposed to be Slough. 'And if you went into Slough you wouldn't see a white face there. We're the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way.' ITV said at the time that it was 'shocked and appalled' at the sentiments.\n",

            "(The Hollywood Reporter)Andrew Lesnie, the Oscar-winning cinematographer who spent more than a decade collaborating with director Peter Jackson on the six \"Lord of the Rings\"and \"Hobbit\" films, has died. He was 59. The Sydney native, who also worked with New Zealander Jackson on the remake of \"King Kong\" (2005) and \"The Lovely Bones\" (2009), suffered a heart attack Monday. Said a spokesman from the Australian Cinematographers Society: \"We have been advised of the sudden death of Andrew,\" adding that his family would provide an official statement later. Known for balancing technology with artistic considerations, Lesnie also shot \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" (2011), directed by Rupert Wyatt. The cinematographer recently polished off The Water Diviner, the directorial debut of Russell Crowe, another New Zealand native. That movie opened Friday in U.S. theaters. Said Crowe on Twitter: \"Devastating news from home. The master of the light, genius Andrew Lesnie has passed on.\" Lesnie won his Oscar for his work on the first of the fabled \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001). His knack for getting the right feel of author J.R.R. Tolkien's most foreboding locales was remarkable. For the inaugural \"Lord of the Rings\" film, Jackson reached out to Lesnie after seeing his work on \"Babe\" (1995) and its 1998 sequel. Those Australian films, revolving around a pig and other animals, featured impressive visual effects and proved to be big hits at the worldwide box office. \"I'd never worked with him or even met him before, but he'd shot the Babe films and I thought they looked amazing, the way he'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect,\" Jackson said in a 2004 interview. \"And Babe had that larger-than-life feel about it that I wanted. \"So when we began looking for DPs in early 1999, I first decided to get either an Australian or New Zealand DP, as they'd be used to the way we make films,\" Jackson continued. \"Every country is slightly different in that way, and I immediately thought of Andrew. \" Lesnie's impressive body of work also includes the post-apocalyptic science fiction film \"I Am Legend\" (2007), directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith; \"The Last Airbender\" (2010), from M. Night Shyamalan; and Healing (2014), helmed by Craig Monahan. He was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002. Lesnie studied film and television at TAFE (a provider of vocational education) and at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School before joining the Australian Broadcasting Corp. as a camera assistant. He honed his craft on low-budget short films and music videos and assisted on documentaries, features and commercials. He then spent several months on \"Wonder World,\" a children's afternoon magazine-style show. People we've lost in 2015 . ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.\n",

            "David Cameron is trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview, Ed Miliband claimed today ahead of tonight's TV debates. The Prime Minister will be absent when Mr Miliband and four other party leaders take part in the televised showdown, after agreeing to just one direct confrontation with his rival in the race for Number 10. Mr Miliband accused the PM of 'ducking' the chance to defend his record in government or explain how he would pay for a host of tax giveaways and spending pledges. Labour leader Ed Miliband addresses supporters during a visit to Crouch End in north London this morning . Mr Cameron has pledged to find £7billion to pay for tax cuts for lower and middle earners, by lifting the point at which people start paying tax and the level when the 40p band kicks in. He has also promised to increase the NHS budget by £8billion a year, while slashing welfare spending by £12billion. Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. The BBC1 debate, hosted by David Dimbleby at 8pm tonight, is the second TV showdown of the campaign, following an ITV broadcast on April 2, also featuring Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, from which no clear winner emerged. Speaking on a campaign visit to north London, Mr Miliband said: 'David Cameron has chosen not to turn up tonight to defend his record. 'Here's what I believe - I think if you are applying for the job of prime minister, the very least the British people expect is for you to turn up to the job interview. 'What I'm going to be doing is setting out the big choice facing our country, between a Labour plan to have a recovery for working families across Britain or more of the same from a government that believes that as long as you look after the rich and powerful everyone else will be okay.' The Labour leader said David Cameron was trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview . Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood . Launching the Conservatives' Scottish manifesto in Glasgow, Mr Cameron denied dodging tonight's debate. Speaking alongside the Tory leader north of the border, Ruth Davidson, at the Emirates Arena, Mr Cameron insisted he had 'unblocked the logjam' that was preventing the events happening at all. 'Tonight's debate is part of the deal that was done to unblock the logjam that there was about TV debates,' Mr Cameron said. 'You are going to hear a lot of different politicians ... while you think they may be saying different things, they are all actually saying the same thing. Ed Miliband will spend the day cramming for tonight's debate after spending the morning campaigning near his home in London . 'They are saying abandon the plan that has turned this country around and got us more jobs, more livelihoods, and more business. That is the truth.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate. David Cameron took questions  with employees of telecommunications company O2 at their offices in Leeds - hundreds of miles away from tonight's TV debate in London . The Prime Minister insisted he was not trying to avoid Mr Miliband - and even claimed he had 'unblocked the log jam' stopping the debates taking place . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gestures as he stands in front of an image of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Prime Minister David Cameron at a campaign event in Cheadle . Responding to Mr Clegg's complaint of being excluded from the debate, a BBC spokesman said: 'Over many months the broadcasters, jointly, have worked hard to ensure that their audiences were offered the best possible combination of programmes to help them engage with the election, to inform them about the issues and to scrutinise the politicians. 'The programmes which have been agreed - including the BBC debate on the 16th - involved all sides, broadcasters and parties, making a number of compromises, allowing the different elements to go ahead. 'For each of the broadcasters, ensuring due impartiality is not only a priority, but an obligation and the BBC is satisfied that the election programmes it is offering on each of its services fulfils that obligation and that all the relevant parties will have the opportunity to put their case - and to be appropriately scrutinised.'\n",

            "Thiago Silva is gearing up to play Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final this week and the Paris Saint-Germain defender believes he will face an attack possessing the three best players in the world. The Spanish league leaders can unleash a front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar upon the French champions, who beat them at the Parc des Princes in the group stages of the competition earlier this year. And Silva believes that the home leg of the quarter-final encounter will be pivotal for his side. Thiago Silva wants PSG to impose their  style of play on Barcelona when they meet in the Champions League . Silva says Luis Suarez (left), Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi are the best three players in the world . Silva (centre) prepared for the visit of Barcelona by lifting the French League Cup with PSG on Saturday . 'We know that the first leg at home will be very important,' the Brazil defender said. 'Barca are very effective on the counterattack and have great strikers. 'To me, Messi, Neymar and Suarez are among the three best players in the world.' Silva singled out the threat of Neymar, his international team-mate, while encouraging his side to impose their own game upon Barcelona. 'He's unpredictable, we cannot know what he will do and don't know where he's going with his dribbles,' Silva said of the Barcelona attacker. Silva warned PSG about the unpredictability of his Brazil international team-mate Neymar . 'Although we face a great rival in Barca, we will try to play our game and keep the ball.

            "Bill and Hillary Clinton spent $104,000 in taxpayer money on hotel rooms for Secret Service agents when they vacationed in the Dominican Republic over the New Year's holiday. A Dominican news report says the power couple spent part of their trip staying with sugar barons Alfy and Pepe Fanjul at Casa de Campo, a private Dominican resort they own. The news outlet Listin Diario reported on January 2 that Fanjul and the Clintons discussed Hillary's presidential ambitions during the visit. Casa de Campo, a luxurious retreat for the world's super wealthy elites, is also at the center of criminal allegations now dogging a Democratic U.S. senator. LAP OF LUXURY: The Casa de Campo resort services the upper crust of America's '1 per cent' super-rich, and both Sen. Bob Menendez and Bill and Hillary Clinton have holidayed there . SAME OLD BILL: This Instagram pic, deleted from a user's account on Thursday, shows former President Clinton cavorting among yougn socialites at Casa de Campo . INDICTED: NEw Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez (left) and his wealthy donor Dr. Salomon Melgen (right) are both accused of multiple federal crimes including bribery and honest services fraud . Federal prosecutors charged New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez with corruption on Wednesday in a 14-count indictment. He is accused of accepting money and trips from wealthy donor Dr Salomon Melgen in exchange for the influence of his office. Melgen flew Menendez and his guests on a private jet to stay at his Casa de Campo villa multiple times, free of charge, prosecutors say. The doctor is also now under federal indictment, accused of bribing Menendez with gifts and approximately $700,000 in political contributions. In exchange, the government says, Menendez helped Melgen's three girlfriends get travel visas to enter the U.S., interceded with Medicare authorities when he was accused of billing fraud, and helped lay the groundwork for a Melgen-controlled company to win a lucrative port security contract in the Dominican Republic. PRIVATE VILLAS: Melgen owns a house at Casa de Campo where he entertained Menendez on several occasions at his own expense . SUGAR BARONS: Pepe Fanjul (left) and Alfy Fanjul (right) own a congromerate that includes Domino Sugar and Florida Crystals, and they also own Casa de Campo. The brothers entertained the Clintons there in early January . Melgen's 70-year-old former secretary told The Miami Herald in 2013 that Melgen had also hosted Bill Clinton at his resort home in the past. And Melgen has contributed $8,600 to Hillary Clinton's campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the White House, according to public records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The Weekly Standard reported on Thursday that the Clintons spent the first part of their Dominican holiday three months ago at Punta Cana, a different resort area. They 'chose to spend their end-of-year vacation in the Dominican Republic's tourist hub Punta Cana,' according to Listin Diario, but on January 2 'shifted to the tourist center Casa de Campo' where they stayed with the Fanjuls. A federal government spending report describes $104,093 in payments for Secret Service lodging, but doesn't specify whether it covered rooms in one or two resort areas. FACING THE MUSIC: Dr. Melgen was in Newark, New Jersey on Thursday to face a judge for his criminal arraignment in the Senator Bob Menendez corruption case . ONE-PERCENTERS: Melgen and Fanjul have houses like this one at Casa de Campo; Bill Clinton has stayed with both of them . Bill and Hillary Clinton were photographed at both resorts. The former president attended 'private dinners with friends at their Casa de Campo villas' and played golf, according to Casa de Campo Living. Alfy Fanjul also played a small part in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that dogged Clinton's 1990s presidency and resulted in his impeachment. Lewinsky told Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr that on Presidents' Day in 1996, as Clinton was trying to break off their covert romance, Fanjul called the Oval Office. Confirmation of that phone call in White House records was one important detail that lent credibility to Lewinsky's claims that she had engaged in a series of intimate moments in the White House with the leader of the free world. WELCOME TO THE D.R.: Hillary and Bill Clinton stayed in the eastern Domonican Republic resort town of Punta Cana before shifting the vacation to Casa de Campo days later . FORE! The former president was photographed playing golf both at Punta Cana (shown) and at Casa de Campo . Security at Casa de Campo keeps out the general public. The only way onto the property for non-residents is to have a reservation at the hotel or at a home on the property. Casa de Campo itself is in La Romana province, on the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The Fanjuls own the sprawling 11-square-mile resort, along with the airport that services it. It's a luxury golf and sporting resort, according to the Menendez indictment, with a marina, three golf courses, three polo fields, equestrian facilities, a 245-acre shooting facility, spa, beaches and a hotel where rooms typically cost about $500 a night.\n",

            "A Connecticut boy who was thrust into the national spotlight before he turned ten because of the way he could throw a baseball will not see his 17th birthday thanks to a drive-by shooting. Jericho Scott, 16, who became an internet star after being told he couldn't pitch for his Little League team because he had a 40mph fastball at age nine, was shot dead in New Haven early on Sunday. Scott was killed while he sat in a white Volkswagen with a 20-year-old friend, Justin Compress, who was shot in the shoulder, hand and wrist but is now in stable condition. Scroll down for video . Jericho Scott (seen at age nine) was killed early on Sunday while he sat in a car in New Haven, Connecticut . Scott became a star when he was told he couldn't pitch for his Little League team because of his fastball . He was banned from the Youth Baseball League of New Haven in 2009 at age nine because he threw 40mph . Scott was the star pitcher for Will Power Fitness team in the Youth Baseball League of New Haven in 2009 when league officials informed him he could no longer pitch for his team. The budding star had five no-hitters in the team's first eight games of the season before he was told he had to sit or switch positions, the Hartford Courant reported. When his manager sent him out to the mound anyway after the ban, the other team refused to play and said its players were afraid of being injured. The story made headlines when lawyers were hired and Scott's team eventually disbanded. The budding star had five no-hitters in the team's first eight games of the season before being told to sit out . When Scott's manager sent him out to pitch after the ban was issued, the other team refused to play the game . His mother, Nicole Scott, said at the time: 'I think it's discouraging when you're telling a nine-year-old you're too good at something. 'The whole objective in life is to find something you're good at and stick with it. 'I'd rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner.' During a 2011 follow-up piece about Scott in the New Journal, his father Leroy also referenced the streets of New Haven and how some of them have 'fourteen-year-olds holding pistols'. That was four years ago, but his sentiment still rings true. A shrine  at the scene. The murder was the city's fourth homicide of 2015 and its first youth killing of the year . Scott's parents wrote: 'Jericho, at only 16, has given so much to his family, friends and the community' Sunday's murder was the city's fourth homicide of 2015 and its first youth killing of the year, the Yale News reported. The Scotts have set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for their son's memorial service and tribute. They wrote: 'Jericho, at only 16, has given so much to his family, friends and the community. 'Jericho was a highly accomplished athlete, scholar and artist. 'Although a short life, it was well lived through love, laughter and positive contributions to his family, friends, teammates and many others in the community. 'And when he played baseball and basketball he touched the lives of people in a profound way.' Scott's friend Justin Compress, 20, who was shot in the shoulder, hand and wrist but is in stable condition . A third man, 19-year-old Tyreese Little, may also have been involved, according to WFSB. Little was reportedly shot several times while at Compress's home and has been 'less than cooperative' with police. The Scotts say their son was not the intended target. Detectives are asking anyone with information about the shooting to contact them at 203-946-6304.\n",

            "Palermo defender Roberto Vitiello hopes the Sicilian outfit can improve its dismal form on the road starting on Sunday at Udinese. The Islanders have not tasted victory away from home since November 2 when they won 2-0 at AC Milan. Mired in a three-game losing streak following last weekend's 2-1 defeat at home to Milan, Palermo are in 11th place and feeling a sense of urgency to turn things around. Roberto Vitiello (left) feels his side need to start winning away from home and ending their poor record . 'We need to keep working hard in order to defend our Serie A status as soon as possible,' Vitiello said to the Italian press. 'We are disappointed not to have collected anything from our last three league games. 'But we must bounce back. Sunday's game at Udinese is important and we will give our all to clinch our second win on the road this season in Friuli.' Palermo, coached by Giuseppe Iachini, have picked up just two points in their last six league games. Udinese are 13th in the standings and one point adrift of Palermo. Mattia Destro (right) fights for the ball with Vitiello during the Italian Serie A football match Palermo vs Milan . After falling victim to bottom-side Parma in midweek, the Friuli side are vulnerable in their own stadium. Udinese have not won in their last four games and coach Andrea Stramaccioni is desperate for a positive reaction from his players. 'Against Parma, we had the wrong approach to the game,' he said. 'My players underestimated Parma and we paid the price. 'We lacked determination and didn't take a shot on goal. 'Now we must turn the page immediately and show against Palermo, the real Udinese.' Udinese were beaten by bottom-side Udinese last time out as they slip closer to the relegation zone . Udinese have struggled to deliver at home and have mustered just one win in their last nine games at Friuli stadium. The hosts must overcome the absence of defender Ivan Piris and midfielder Giampiero Pinzi, both serving a one-match ban. Palermo are without midfielder Edgar Barreto, who is sidelined for three weeks with a muscular injury. Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala, who is Palermo's top scorer with 13 goals, will lead the Rossaneri's attack on Sunday with Franco Vazquez playing in support. Highly-coveted forward Paulo Dybala will lead the line for Palermo as they look to pick up three points .\n",

            "It's that time of year when football managers double as mathematicians. With points running out and prizes at a premium, they're praying the calculator tells them the dream is still alive. But for those at the top of a claustrophobic Championship, the maths is simple — win every game or risk missing out on a potential £120million payday. Two points separate four teams, with four games remaining. To drop points would almost certainly mean to drop out of the race for the two automatic slots to the Barclays Premier League. Middlesbrough were top on Good Friday but are fourth going into the visit of Wolves. Aitor Karanka is not wasting his time on permutations. Lee Tomlin (centre) fires Middlesbrough 1-0 ahead against Rotherham United in the Championship match . Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka (right) is targeting wins from all of his side's remaining fixtures this season . 'We have to win our games,' said the Spaniard. 'I think by winning four games we will get promotion, but it is very difficult. We have to forget the other teams and just concentrate on our games.' Wolves are seven points behind Boro but only outside the play-offs on goal difference after Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Midlands rivals Birmingham. And head coach Kenny Jackett admits they have played must-win games for a while. He said: 'It seems to have been that way for about three months, where we have been chasing. 'We have been working hard to make sure the sides at the top don't get away. It's good we're in this position. We want to be a Premier League club.' Callum Wilson (left) is congratulated after scoring his side's second goal against Brighton in their last game . Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe insists that his side are not getting carried away at the top of the table . The Championship leaders Bournemouth travel to Reading. And the message from Eddie Howe to his team is very much: 'Don't get ahead of yourselves'. 'With every win, we take it away from some of the teams that have been challenging all season, but I still think it is anyone's,' said Howe. 'We have to focus on every game, not get complacent, and remember that this league has a habit of throwing up surprises. We want to make sure that we stay strong until the end.' Norwich are the division's form team having won four on the spin and, ahead of their trip to Leeds, manager Alex Neil said: 'My job is simple. I said it before (Saturday's 2-1 win at Bolton) we had five left and we had to win every one. Now we have four it's the same.' Bolton Wanderers' Josh Vela (left) and Norwich City's Nathan Redmond (right) battle for the ball . Watford are the team sandwiched in third and they have the benefit of seeing how their rivals perform before they take on Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Wednesday. The leading quartet could all guarantee their place in the play-offs at least with midweek victories. But for the chasing pack, four must go into two. Derby, Ipswich, Brentford and Wolves are within just one point of each other and must produce title-winning form between now and May 2 to be sure of post-season participation. Meanwhile, matters at the bottom of the table have been complicated after Rotherham were charged yesterday with fielding an ineligible player. Derby loanee Farrend Rawson played in their 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday but there is confusion as to whether the defender had already been recalled. Rotherham are seven points above the drop zone and will nervously await the outcome of their FA hearing, especially if Millwall — with a game in hand — narrow that gap to four with victory over fellow strugglers Wigan. Elsewhere in the Football League this week, Bristol City will be Championship-bound with a win at Bradford City, while Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's Burton Albion side and Shrewsbury could leave League Two behind them if they triumph against Carlisle and Bury respectively — and other results go their way.

            "This is the moment an unlucky man was gored between the legs by a rampaging bull after being knocked to the ground during a bullrunning celebration in Spain. The unnamed man was sprinting ahead of the animal, trying to make it to the safety behind a set of iron bars when the angry animal sent him sprawling to the floor. And despite his desperate efforts to climb back up, the bull appeared to hit him right in the bottom with one of its horns as he tried to scramble away. Scroll down for video . This unlucky man was gored during a bullrunning event in Teulada, a small coastal town on Spain's Costa Blanca, after falling over in front of the beast . The man, who has not been identified, was seen running away from the angry animal before it caught him with one horn, sending him sprawling to the floor . Pictures show him crawling desperately towards the safety of the bull bars, but he was unable to make it before the horn hit him square between the legs . The unfortunate incident happened on the street in Teulada, a small coastal town on Spain's Costa Blanca, during the annual fiesta. The celebrations begin on April 8 and last until April 19, and include floatillas and parades celebrating the town's patron saint, Sant Vicent Ferrer. As part of the fiesta, large, aggressive bulls are let loose to run around the streets, with local and visitors invited to run alongside them. The challenge is to tease the animals before escaping behind one of the wooden pallets or iron bull bars to safety. Witnesses said the man was seen limping towards medical crews after the attack, but was unsupported and appeared not to have been seriously hurt . The bullrunning takes place during the town's annual fiesta, which includes float parades in honour of Sant Vicent Ferrer, the village's patron saint . Websites advertising the bull running recommend leaving the sport to the experienced locals, noting that the animals are faster than people think, and that it is mostly foreigners that get injured. While it is not known where this man came from, he was seen limping away to be tended by medical crews after the attack. He was not though to have been seriously injured.\n",

            "It was one of the most horrific disasters of the First World War, which still haunts the descendants of those who died. Yesterday, as commemorations were held all over the world to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, the Royal Family led tributes to those who fought and fell in the ill-fated offensive. The day began in London with a dawn ceremony at Wellington Arch on Hyde Park Corner, attended by Princess Anne. Later the Queen, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince William and political leaders, led the nation during a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, while Prince Charles was in Turkey with Prince Harry.

The national flags of Australia, New Zealand, Turkey and the UK were carried through the Abbey and placed close to the high altar as a sign of reconciliation between old enemies. Earlier, Charles and Harry joined more than 10,000 people in a dawn pilgrimage at Gallipoli to honour the bravery of the Allied troops who stormed the peninsula's beaches in 1915. The landings were supposed to be a decisive blow that would knock the Turks out of the war. But eight months of bloody fighting later, after an estimated 145,000 lives on both sides had been lost, the Allies pulled out, having failed in their objective. Around 58,000 Allied troops were killed, many from Australia and New Zealand. Almost 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen are buried or commemorated on Gallipoli. Prince Charles gave a moving reading about troops weeping as they left their dead comrades behind when they left Gallipoli. He read the words of a soldier, who wrote: 'The hardest feature of the evacuation was in leaving those dead comrades behind. They had bequeathed us a sacred trust.'

            "Court bill of £500: Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground . A grandmother of four told of her fury today after being fined more than £500 for dropping a cigarette butt. Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground - before two council officers came ‘sprinting’ towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence. Miss Copeland was then issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice following the incident in October last year, but refused to pay it within ten days in protest at how she was treated. However, after failing to pay, she eventually received a letter ordering her to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates’ Court on March 17. She was then fined £304 by magistrates who also ordered her to pay £200 court costs. Miss Copeland was unable to attend the hearing because she had to look after her son Chez, 17, who has autism, and has now criticised the city council for taking her to court. She said: ‘I was doing some shopping and was walking back home and cut through a couple of car parks. I heard these tyres screeching behind me and all of a sudden two women got out and started sprinting towards me. ‘I didn’t know whether to drop my shopping and put my hands in the air or walk towards them. I realised they had council uniforms on and they starting asking me if I was aware I had committed a criminal offence. ‘The first thing I thought was something hadn’t gone through the till properly at Sainsbury’s. I hadn’t even realised I had a cigarette. It is just automatic. 'I must have lit one up when I came out of the shop. My generation just discard the butts on the floor. If I had dumped a three-piece suite, then fair enough - but it was just a cigarette end.' Miss Copeland added: ‘They were just so stern and officious. The way they spoke to me was horrible. It is the whole manner, they acted as if I had murdered somebody.’ The grandmother, who also has three grown-up daughters, is now considering whether to pay the fine by the deadline - which is tomorrow. If she refuses she could be taken back to court. Hearing: After failing to pay Miss Copeland was told to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates' Court (pictured) Miss Copeland said: ‘I’ve been treated like I have committed a major criminal offence. I didn’t pay because of how they were towards me but also the principle. ‘I’ve always been led to believe the punishment should fit the crime and in this case it doesn’t. I find it shocking. They are now saying I will face imprisonment if I don’t pay the fine. 'I don’t want to pay it because I won’t sleep at night if I do, but I might have to. I thought they were bluffing and it was scaremongering - I can’t believe they took someone to court over something this little.’ A Coventry City Council spokesman said the authority had a ‘zero tolerance’ policy towards litter. Andrew Walster, who oversees the council’s streets policy, added: ‘It costs us about £2.5million a year to clean the streets in Coventry. There are plenty of litter bins within the city.’\n",

            "Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties . Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal . The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him . Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved . Reading: Federici, Gunter, Hector, Pearce, Obita, McCleary, Williams, Chalobah (Cox, 106), Robson-Kanu (Karacan, 90), Mackie, Pogrebnyak (Yakubu, 111). Subs not used: Stephen Kelly, Norwood, Yakubu, Andersen, Cooper. Booked: Chalobah . Goal: McCleary, 54 . Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker (Gabriel, 63), Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin (Walcott, 101), Cazorla, Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez, Welbeck (Giroud, 72). Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106 . When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’ Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’ Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time . Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored . But Reading goalkeeper Federici made a splendid one-handed save to tip the ball up and against the crossbar . Sanchez (centre) earlier took the ball past goalkeeper  Federici (second left) before losing his footing and falling . Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal . It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici .

            "Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new £400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a ‘slide-out’ grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are ‘looking at options’ in order to ‘future-proof the design’. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their £757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year’s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: ‘The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’\n",

            "US officials are expected to stop prosecuting families of American hostages who communicate with kidnappers abroad or raise funds and pay ransoms. A National Counterterrorism Center advisory group, ordered by the White House, is expected to recommend what would mark a radical shift in US hostage policy, ABC news reported on Sunday. The NCTC interviewed families of hostages, including the parents of journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State fighters. The family of a US contractor held by Al-Qaeda militants, Warren Weinstein (above), confirmed they paid a ransom in an attempt to secure his release which was reported in the amount of $250,000 . Foley's mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son, and warned that her family could face prosecution for doing so. The Obama administration has denied making any such threats. 'There will be absolutely zero chance of any family member of an American held hostage overseas ever facing jail themselves, or even the threat of prosecution, for trying to free their loved ones,' a senior official told ABC News. Meanwhile, the family of US contractor Warren Weinstein, who was snatched by Al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, confirmed it had paid a ransom to try to secure his release, which was in the amount of $250,000, according to CBS News. A spokesman for the family said it had 'made every effort to engage with those holding him or those with the power to find and rescue him.' 'This is an ordinary American family and they are not familiar with how one manages a kidnapping,' the spokesman added. Hostage James Foley was killed by Islamic State fighters. His mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son . 'As such, they took the advice of those in government who deal with such issues on a regular basis and were disappointed that their efforts were not ultimately successful.' It was unclear what sort of advice the family received from US government officials. Diane Foley welcomed the potential policy shift, which officials discussed with her last week. 'There's a lot that needs to be fixed,' she told ABC News. She said the past threats were 'the straw that broke the camel's back. It was incredible.' A number of hostage families expressed outrage after US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was freed by the Haqqani Network in Pakistan a year ago in exchange for the release of five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo Bay military prison. Army Lieutenant General Bennet Sacolick, who previously headed the elite Delta Force counterterrorism unit, is heading the hostage policy review team, along with his NCTC staff.\n",

            "A man was allegedly bashed by a family with glass bottles and windscreen wipers at a McDonald's drive-through after he waved at them thinking they were his friends. Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin. The man's 22-year-old girlfriend, Rachael Sheppard, told the NT News he had just gestured at the family by waving with his little pinky as people do in Darwin. Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin . 'Then we arrived at Maccas and pulled up and the same car came through the drive through and the man got out and started yelling at us and asking what the hand gesture was all about and going right off his head,' Ms Sheppard said. Despite telling the family they thought they were someone different, the older man allegedly started bashing Mr Mcinerney. 'He even smashed a beer bottle over Col's head... it didn't look good,' Ms Sheppard said. 'I was yelling for him to stop and next thing you know three boys have jumped out of the back of their car and started bashing Col too.' Ms Sheppard said a woman behind the wheel of the car allegedly tried to ram her as Mr Mcinerney ran for cover at a nearby petrol station. '(They) caught up with Col and kept bashing and choking him,' she said. 'The younger boys were grabbing windscreen cleaners and water bottles and even had a windscreen wiper off their own car that they were using to attack Col with.' NT Police Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen says officers were called to the McDonalds about 7.15pm following reports of a 'violent disturbance'. NT Police Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen says officers were called to the McDonalds near Darwin about 7.15pm following reports of a 'violent disturbance' 'It was confirmed that two groups were travelling in their respective vehicles in the rural area when they pulled up beside each other at a set of traffic lights,' she said in a statement. 'One did a hand gesture to which another took offence. Both vehicles pulled over in McDonalds and a nasty altercation ensued.' Supt Jorgensen said most of the passengers in the vehicles became involved, including the girlfriends and children of both drivers. 'There were accusations of weapons being involved and one of the parties ramming the other's vehicle,' she said. Police arrived when the altercation had moved to the service station. Supt Jorgensen said Mr Mcinerney and the 35-year-old male drive and his 36-year-old female companion were arrested and later released without charge. The men were taken to Royal Darwin Hospital for treatment. Witnesses are urged to contact Police on 131444 or Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000.\n",

            "A Ukip MEP has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a ‘very strong leader’ who has ‘put Russia first’. Diane James, Ukip’s Justice Spokesman, also applauded Mr Putin's nationalist credentials and argued he was forced into invading Ukraine because of the European Union. Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked a row last year when he hailed Russian President as a ‘brilliant operator'. Scroll down for video . Praising Putin: Diane James, Ukip's Justice Spokesperson applauded Russian President Vladimir Putin's nationalist credentials . Taking part in a women leaders' debate on LBC radio, Mrs James - who is considered a potential successor of Nigel Farage - said: ‘Nigel went on record saying if you provoke the Russian bear you get a reaction. ‘I admire him from the point of view that he’s standing up for his country. He is very nationalist. ‘He is a very strong leader. He is putting Russia first, and he has issues with the way the EU encouraged a change of government in the Ukraine which he felt put at risk a Russian population in that country,' she said. Mrs James was the Ukip candidate in the Eastleigh by-election and currently represents the south east of England in the European Parliament. Ukip leader Nigel Farage caused controversy in March 2014 after he admitted he admired Putin as a ‘brilliant operator’ for his stance on the Syrian conflict. However, unlike Mrs James, he clarified his view on Putin by adding: ‘Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?’ His comments followed the annexation of Crimea, but before the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine and the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which is widely believed to have been carried out by Russian-supported separatists. Mrs James told presenter Iain Dale (far left) that she admires Putin because he stands up for his country . Ukip smiles: Diane James is widely considered to be Nigel Farage's successor as the leader of Ukip . Mrs James' comments came as Ukip’s election campaign chief admitted the party sometimes resembles a ‘rugby club on tour’ with members who can be ‘boorish’ and ‘chauvinistic’. Patrick O’Flynn, who is also the party’s economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to ‘work harder’ as it is ‘lagging’ behind with female voters. As he launched the party’s ‘policies for women’ alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and Mrs James, Mr O’Flynn was forced to defend its ‘blokeish’ image under Nigel Farage. Mrs James' comments come as Ukip's campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn said the party resembled a 'rugby club on tour' He said: ‘Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. ‘But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. ‘We’re a very fast-growing party, we’re increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we’re not maximising our support in every potential group. ‘And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we’ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.’ The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. The party used the event to confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a ‘tampon tax’. It also said it would give ‘absolute, full and unconditional’ support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are ‘properly resourced’. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is ‘accepted cultural practice’ for some of ‘our ethnic compatriots’. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party’s election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on ‘lies’ and ‘myths’ spread about the party. She said: ‘I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. ‘There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. ‘Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.’ Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as ‘sluts’. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women’s event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave. In a 2010 interview, the party leader who has often been photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer, also boasted: ‘I’ve got so many women pregnant over the years.’\n",

The 31-year-old London flight attendant has undergone 30 body-changing operations, including four rhinoplasties, liposuction and six-pack implants. After doctors in the UK started turning him away, he began jet setting to other countries for cosmetic surgery - even approaching Botched doctors Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif about getting back implants on last season's show, who ultimately said no to his request. 'He wanted to look like Tarzan or Hercules ... a skinny Hercules to build up his back so he wouldn't have to work out,' Dr Dubrow told People. 'It was crazy.' Scroll down for video . Barbie world: Rodrigo Alves, who is dubbed the new Human Ken Doll after having 30 plastic surgeries, is appearing on the new season of the E! reality show Botched . Blue steel: The 31-year-old flight attendant showed off his tan when he posed for this selfie this week . But the outlet reports that Mr Alves won't be looking for more procedures this time around. Instead, he is visiting the reality show to 'assist another patient'. 'It's not gratuitous at all. He's extremely helpful,' Dr Dubrow said. While Dr Dubrow said that Mr Alves' look is not their 'aesthetic' per se, he noted that the show's guest star hasn't asked for any of his surgeries to be reversed. Last week, Mr Alves took to Instagram promote his appearance on the show, writing: 'Catch me on botched 2 on E! Premier is on the 14th [sic].' Sculpted silicon: Rodrigo, who has had pec and six-pack implants, confidently flaunted his body in a zebra print speedo . Before and after: Two months ago, Rodrigo shared a photo of his 'old face' (L) and his 'new face' (R) Strike a pose: The London flight attendant lounged seductively in a lounge chair for this snapshot . Fine diing: Rodrigo can be seen enjoying a meal while taking in the beach side view . Back in January, Mr Alves flew to Colombia for his most recent set of surgeries. The six-in-one procedure, which cost nearly $75,000, included his fourth nose job, an operation to fix his droopy eyes and another to pin his toes back. He also had the surgeons cut the skin around his mouth and gums to make his smile bigger. But despite already undergoing dozens of procedures, Mr Alves has admitted that he will never stop going under the knife because he is dedicated to his continuous transformation.

Once you start, it is difficult to stop. Naturally I’m a perfectionist. It’s like a snowball effect and I’m not going to stop. 'It doesn’t define the man that I am - I’m much more than silicone and cosmetic surgery - but once you get started it’s difficult to stop.’ Mr Alves had his first surgery in 2004 after he moved to London and found himself feeling unattractive compared to the people he met. A generous inheritance from his grandfather allowed him to embark on his questing with perfection, beginning with a nose job. 'I don't think that I will really regret anything in the future,' he said in January. 'I really believe that everything I've done to myself was an investment.'

            "A man who launched an online campaign to help him destroy his brand new $49,000 Jeep will read out a 'not sorry' apology to the company on national television tonight. In June last year,  Ashton Wood raised $18,000 online so he and 300 people could destroy his car after Jeep refused to pay a full refund for the car or replace the vehicle which he claimed had suffered 21 separate mechanical problems. During a failed settlement between the manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Jeep, and Mr Wood, one of the requests made by the car company was for the disgruntled buyer to publish an 'apology' in a national publication. However, because no one would publish the apology, he will instead read it out on the ABC's 'The Checkout' tonight. Scroll down for video . Ashton Wood issued this apology to Jeep after the car company requested he apologise for criticising them . The Queenslander launched a public campaign last year asking others to help him destroy his car in protest . Compiled by Mr Wood and the ABC's The Checkout, the apology reads: 'My personal apology to Jeep: I'm Sorry. 'Dear Jeep, I'm sorry. I'm sorry my Jeep broke down before it even left the dealership. 'I'm sorry it had 21 problems. I'm sorry it had to be towed four times. I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful for your offer of a new battery. 'I'm sorry you wouldn't offer me a replacement or refund. But most of all, I'm sorry I bought a Jeep.' Mr Wood launched a Kickstarter campaign last year in an effort to raise $22,500 - the amount Chrysler offered him to buyback the car - and allow donors the chance to be involved in the car's destruction. He is now campaigning for the United State's Lemon laws to be introduced in Australia. Pictured: 'lemon car' drivers protest against vehicle companies who refuse to refund or replace their cars . Mr Wood's extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems . The extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking. He claims years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his car, which he bought from a Sunshine Coast dealer in Queensland had proved fruitless. Despite successfully destroying his vehicle, Mr Wood - who could not afford to challenge the international car company in court - has refused to back down. Along with a number of consumer led organsiations Mr Wood is campaigning for the United States' Lemon Laws to be introduced in Australia. These included the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking . He said that Lemon Laws state 'that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked' 'Lemon is the old term which was used to mean a really bad car. In the U.S. they have had the Lemon Law's in place for about 35 years, we don't have it,' Mr Wood told Daily Mail Australia. 'They differ from state to state but in Kansas, where they have the most strict version, is states that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked. 'It's a lot clearer than Australian consumer laws which just says that the product should be fit for purpose and the dealer should do the right thing. 'I'm not done yet. I want to keep the pressure up until the government sits up and takes some responsibility and reviews this law.' Consumer laws have somewhat improved since Mr Wood's story came to the public's attention, by including a notion of 'major failure'. However, they still remain unclear about a car owner's rights when their vehicle has a number of smaller problems like Mr Wood's. After Mr Wood's car was destroyed, a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal . Along with Lemon Laws for Australia and Lemon Vehicles in Australia, Mr Wood has launched several petitions and staged a number of events campaigning for more specific laws that address the holes in the legislation. They have sent out Lemon Law stickers to hundreds of Australians with 'lemon cars' in order to 'put pressure on the government and show that the movement is gaining momentum'. A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner'. Mr Woods car was destroyed over four hours with the help of 300 people who wielded bats and sledgehammers and shot bow and arrows at it at a demolition derby last year. More than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it . A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner' 'The car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof,' Mr Wood said. 'The whole car lifted two, maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire.' He said the 'Pièce de résistance' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot. 'The serious side to it is that I shouldn't have had to destroy a $50,000 car,' he said. 'If the law was there today and if Chrysler group respected and looked after its customers then it wouldn't have had to happen.' Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000. Despite knowing he could make $28,000 by selling it himself, he said felt uncomfortable with the option. Mr Wood's apology can be seen in full on Thursday night at 8pm on ABC's The Checkout.

            "A size 28 woman who was a bridesmaid three times is celebrating shedding six stone - and is planning to walk down the aisle as a bride. Frankie Ruttledge, from Strensall, Yorkshire, weighed 18 stone 7lbs and had struggled with her weight all her life before dieting to a svelte size 10/12. The 24-year-old, who has been a 'fat bridesmaid' three times, ditched her diet of crisps for breakfast, pork pies for lunch and frozen pizza for dinner and dropped to 12 stone in less than two years. Frankie, pictured left at her Mum's wedding in 2010, always thought of herself as the 'fat bridesmaid' however she has now lost six stone and is looking forward to her own wedding . And now the Slimming World consultant is just one year away from walking down the aisle for a fourth time - to marry the love of her life Luke Haynes, 24. Frankie said: 'I have always been bigger - as a child I was always the biggest in my class. I just ate rubbish and had a really poor diet. I ate a lot of pasties and sausage rolls. 'I didn't think I'd ever be different. But then in September 2012 my sister asked me to be her bridesmaid and I promised her I would lose weight for her wedding. 'I wanted to look good for her wedding, but I just kept getting bigger and bigger - I couldn't shift the weight. Frankie poses with her fiance Luke Haynes, the pair are planning to marry next year and Frankie hopes to wear a size ten dress . 'It wasn't until that Christmas when my Aunty said to me she was shocked at how big I was, that it actually hit home. It was a bit of a rude awakening for me. I was mortified. 'When I lost the weight I actually sent her a card to say thank you. 'The bridesmaid dress they got for me was a size 28 - I was devastated. But in the end I fitted into a size 16 dress and I felt absolutely amazing that day.' Frankie was the Bridesmaid for many weddings over the years, by 2013 though (left) she had begun to lose weight and wore a size 16 dress for her sister's wedding . Frankie looks pleased as she holds up a pair of her own shorts. She has dropped from a size 22 to a size 10/12 . Frankie, who runs three Slimming World groups, was spurred on to turn her life around after a family member made a comment about how big she had gotten. And after her sister asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding - in May 2013 - Frankie gave it her all and watched as the pounds just seemed to drop off. Frankie joined a local Slimming World group and by changing her diet, and going to Zumba and aqua fit classes at the gym, she shed an amazing five stone in the first year. Breakfast: . Nothing. Crisps and dip as a snack later . Lunch: . A pasty or pork pie . Evening Meal: . Frozen pizza or a take away and pints of cider . Breakfast: . Yoghurt, oats and fruit . Lunch: . Stir fry or a Slimming World healthy fry up . Evening: . Homemade chilli or spaghetti bolognese . Frankie was not happy with her size and was spurred on to lose the weight by an aunt who commented that she was 'shocked' at how big she had become . Frankie and Luke lark about with a pair of her old trousers, Frankie was previously a size 22 . And it took her another 12 months to budge the final stone - tipping the scales at a much slimmer 12 stone five pounds before Christmas. Frankie said: 'The weight came off quickly and I just stuck to it. And the more weight I lost, the more I wanted to go to the gym as I didn't want to have any loose skin. 'And now I am just a much healthier person. I will go out for a run or take the dog for a long walk. I still want to lose a bit more but weight loss is an ongoing journey. I still have to work hard at it. 'And my next goal is my own wedding in the summer - I can't wait to walk down the aisle as a size 10 bride. 'My mum and future mother and sister-in-law are slimming too for it so we are all doing it together. It's great for me to see how my weight loss has had an impact on so many other people.'\n",

            "Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games for conduct detrimental to the National Football League. The decision to ban Hardy, who last played for the Carolina Panthers, followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games . Domestic violence charges against Hardy, who signed with Dallas last month, were abruptly dropped in February after his accuser could not be found to testify. The jury trial for Hardy had been set to begin in Charlotte after he was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Nicole Holder, and threatening to kill her. The league's probe, which involved numerous interviews with witnesses and experts, concluded that Hardy violated the NFL's personal conduct policy by using physical force against Holder in at least four instances. 'The net effect of these acts was that Ms. Holder was severely traumatized and sustained a range of injuries, including bruises and scratches on her neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, arms and feet,' Goodell wrote. 'The use of physical force under the circumstances present here, against a woman substantially smaller than you and in the presence of powerful, military-style assault weapons, constitutes a significant act of violence in violation of the Personal Conduct Policy.' Hardy arrives at Mecklenburg County jail on the first day of his domestic violence appeal trail . Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, was accused of assaulting Holder last May, sending her to the hospital emergency room. The five-year NFL veteran was found guilty by a district court judge in July but appealed the verdict and was allowed to have a jury trial. Prosecutors said when Holder last spoke with them in November, she told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' Holder had already reached a civil settlement with Hardy, prosecutors said. Hardy may appeal the NFL's decision within three days. 'You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement and must not commit any additional violations of league policies,' Goodell wrote. 'In that respect, you should understand that another violation of this nature may result in your banishment from the NFL.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

            "Rotor Volgograd, one of Russia's leading clubs in the 1990s and who famously beat Manchester United in the UEFA Cup 20 years ago, have been wound up after going bankrupt. The team from the Volga region of Russia were competing in the second division in the southern zone, which is effectively Russian football's third tier. Volgograd is one of the 11 host cities for the 2018 World Cup although Rotor did not play at the Victory Arena which will have a capacity of 45,000 spectators. Rotor Volgograd have been wound up after going bankrupt - picture shows the Russian outfit take on David Beckham (pictured) and his then Manchester United team-mates in 1995 . Rotor Volgograd celebrate after their surprise UEFA Cup triumph against Manchester United in 1995 . Sir Alex Ferguson checks his watch during Man United's defeat on away goals against Rotor Volgograd . A Manchester United side containing the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were eliminated from the first round of the UEFA Cup in 1995. Manchester United drew 0-0 with Rotor in Russia before their elimination from Europe's second tier competition on away goals. The English side crashed out of Europe despite Paul Scholes and Peter Schmeichel's goals at Old Trafford. 'The Volgograd Region's administration have signed an official document concerning the bankruptcy of Rotor,' the club's website stated (www.rotor-fc.com). In April a 'new' amateur club, which will also be known as Rotor Volgograd, will take part in the Russian third division. 'Over time, the Volgograd Region's administration plan to turn Rotor Volgograd into a legally binding structure, which will allow them to compete at a professional level,' the club added. Rotor, founded in 1929, finished runners-up in the Russian Premier League in 1993 and 1997. In September 1995 they knocked a United side containing the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane, out of the UEFA Cup at the first round stage. After a 0-0 draw in Russia, Rotor drew 2-2 at Old Trafford to go through on away goals. In 2005 Rotor lost their professional status but were reformed a year later and have since been competing in the lower divisions.

            "Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home . Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently . Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.\n",

            "A bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how Tom Wood’s Northampton prepared for Saturday’s top-of-the-table meeting with Saracens. The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints’ opponents have ‘smelt blood’, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results . The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf . ‘I don’t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,’ said Wood. ‘Some people think you’re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It’s a couple of per cent across the board. ‘You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It’s a combination of things and it’s difficult to manage. ‘Now there’s light at the end of the tunnel and we’re not far off full strength. It’s the home straight.’ Saturday’s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin’s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton’s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. ‘We’ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,’ said Wood. ‘Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. ‘When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We’ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don’t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes . ‘We’ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don’t think we’ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.’ But Saints’ season is still very much alive. They will almost guarantee a home play-off with victory while, in contrast, Harlequins campaign will be over if they lose to Sale. The west London club also felt the squeeze of the Six Nations and they must win at the AJ Bell Stadium to keep alive their slim hopes of Champions Cup qualification. Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season . For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. ‘I’m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,’ said Monye. ‘It’s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I’ve been here since I finished school and it’s all I’ve known. I might be locking horns with Mark Cueto, who’s also retiring, this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time I faced him.’ GLOUCESTER v NEWCASTLE (SATURDAY: Kingsholm, 3pm) Dan Robson and Billy Burns form a new half-back pairing for the hosts, in a reshuffled side led by Billy Twelvetrees. Will Welch and Ally Hogg return to the Newcastle back row after injury breaks. PREDICTION: Home win. LEICESTER V LONDON WELSH (SATURDAY: Welford Road, 3pm) England lock contender Graham Kitchener makes a first Tigers appearance since February, alongside Brad Thorn. Olly Barkley reclaims the Exiles’ No 10 shirt and ex-Leicester flanker Ben Pienaar also starts. PREDICTION: Home win. NORTHAMPTON V SARACENS (SATURDAY: Stadium MK, 3.15pm) Courtney Lawes has been passed fit to return for Saints, while prop Salesi Ma’afu comes in to reinforce the pack. Schalk Brits lines up at hooker for Saracens, but Owen Farrell and Chris Ashton are on the bench. PREDICTION: Home win. SALE v HARLEQUINS (SATURDAY: AJ Bell Stadium, 2pm) The Sharks have shifted Josh Beaumont into the second row, to allow TJ Ioane to start at No 8. Quins are still without England full back Mike Brown and have brought in George Lowe at outside centre. PREDICTION: Home win. WASPS v EXETER (SUNDAY: Ricoh Arena, 2pm) Nathan Hughes will wear No 8 for Wasps after having a suspension overturned, while Christian Wade is fit to start. Phil Dollman is out with a leg injury, so Byron McGuigan takes over at full back for Exeter. PREDICTION: Home win.\n",

            "A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. In one case mother Lisa Parkisson, 35, also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son Zac in June this year. In another case newborn Thomas Beaty died from head injuries in April after medics forced him back into the womb during birth. Doctors had also tried and failed to remove him from the womb five times using forceps, despite national guidelines only recommending three attempts. While his death was not included in the review, staff at North Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which controls the two hospitals, have asked investigators to look into it. Martin Beaty, the father of Thomas, said: 'Ten deaths in eight months is sickening. But I'm not surprised. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . The report, which also looked into the deaths of three babies and another mother at North Manchester General, found that national guidelines for treating obese mothers were also not followed . 'The standard of care we received during and after Thomas died gives me zero confidence in their organisation, structure and accountability. 'I'm angry we were not informed [about the report], even if out of courtesy. It feels like they're trying to cover each other's backs. 'But I'm fully behind any action that makes sure this sort of thing is prevented in the future.' Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Royal Oldham Hospital's new maternity unit, children's unit and neonatal intensive care unit opened in December 2012. The £44m facility became one of three specialist Greater Manchester neonatal centres as part of a controversial £120m shake-up which saw maternity units shut in Bury, Rochdale and Salford. Gill Harris, Chief Nurse at Pennine Acute, said: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'\n",

            "Ten-year-old twin brothers obsessed with naval history had their passion come to life as they heard first-hand battle stories from their new best friend - 89-year-old World War II veteran, Robert Harding. Carter and Jack Hanson, who live in Raleigh, North Carolina, met their hero on the Yorktown - a retired carrier in Charleston, where Mr Harding served as an aircraft handler decades before, CBS reported. It was an emotional first meeting for the three friends who had been in contact for about a year via email after the twins learned about Mr Harding on their first trip to Yorktown and the Patriot's Point museum. Scroll down for video . World War II veteran Bob Harding, of Oklahoma, began exchanging emails with Carter and Jack Hanson of Raleigh, North Carolina about a year ago. They recently had the chance to meet each other on board the Yorktown aircraft carrier where he once served . Unbreakable bond: The three friends had an emotional first meeting on the retired war ship during a recent visit to Charleston, South Carolina . Mr Harding (pictured) served as an aircraft handler on the warship many decades before his young friends were born . The friends sent each other emails every day but only got to meet on board the Yorktown recently. They spent the day exploring the ship together with the boys hearing first-hand just what life was like on board a real battleship. The boys told CBS in an interview that meeting Mr Harding, who lives in Oklahoma, has changed their lives. Carter said: 'We want to know what his voice actually sounds like. We want to touch him. We want to know him a lot more.' The ten-year-old added: 'I just realized how amazing history can be.' And getting first-person history lessons hasn't only been good for the twins, it appeared Mr Harding had been looking for someone to share his stories with. The veteran told CBS: 'I guess I needed somebody to talk to about it. It's surprising the way it worked out.' The 89-year-old vet is still married and has a couple of children along with grandchildren and several great grandchildren. The Yorktown after an American revolutionary war battle and she is the fourth U.S. Navy ship to hold the name. She was renamed to commemorate USS Yorktown (CV-5), lost at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The carrier was commissioned in 1943 and was active in battles with Japan in the Pacific Theater. Mr Harding, 89, said that meeting the boys has been great for him as he has not shared a lot of stories from the wartime .

            "A former elementary school teacher who police say was obsessed with one of her 11-year-old students has waived a preliminary hearing on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's legal custody. Geraldine Alcorn, 29, of Pittsburgh, and her attorney declined to comment as they walked from a city magistrate's courtroom Wednesday. In exchange for the waiver — which means Alcorn must now stand trial on the charge or take some kind of plea bargain — Allegheny County prosecutors dropped two other misdemeanors she faced: luring a child into a vehicle and corruption of minors. Leaving court: Geraldine Alcorn, left, leaves court on Wednesday April 1, 2015, in Pittsburgh after waiving a preliminary hearing on  Wednesday on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's custody . Geraldine Alcorn, pictured walking to court on Wednesday, allegedly encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even spoke of adopting her . Obsessed teacher: Geraldine Alcorn, 28, faces multiple charges for 'obsessively' texting an 11-year-old student . Prosecutors, who also declined to comment, allege Alcorn encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even talked of adopting and running away with the girl before Alcorn resigned last month. The girl's mother, a single parent, complained to school officials after finding out Alcorn had visited the girl at their home while the mother was working. The mother then found stickers and letters from Alcorn in the girl's school binder, plus two letters the girl wrote to Alcorn with three headings: 'Things Ms. Alcorn and I can do,' ''what we can do,' and 'when we can do it,' the criminal complaint said. The girl told police she and Alcorn kept their relationship secret and, among other things, Alcorn discussed adopting the girl or taking her from her home. Alcorn had told the girl that 'they would be on the run for a while,' if Alcorn followed through on that, police said. Alcorn is not believed to have sexual feelings for the girl but allegedly told police of a 'deep love' she has for her. Pittsburgh Public Schools officials learned Feb. 13 that 'a teacher had developed an improper attachment' with a student at Pittsburgh Beechwood, a pre-K-5 school. Alcorn resigned March 2. Police said she tried to contact the girl on March 13, a Friday, when Alcorn returned to gather her personal belongings. The following Monday, police said, the girl found 'gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,' according to the criminal complaint. 'The letters, written by Alcorn, instructed the 11-year-old female to contact her.' Alcorn hid her phone number on a math worksheet by telling the girl to dial numbers that had been circled, police said. Planned to run away: Geraldine Alcorn, left, leaving court on Wednesday, told the little girl she planned to run away with her and adopt her . Talked of going on the run: Attorney, Michael Worgul, left, leads Geraldine Alcorn, center left, down the steps from court Wednesday after she was accused of 'interfering with the child's custody' Didn't stop contact: Alcorn continued to contact the student even after she was forced to resign and warned to stay away from the 11-year-old, police say .\n",

            "Many of us may not have the billionaire lifestyle or scientific prowess of Marvel's Tony Stark, but we can now at least get his trademark hi-tech gloves at home. Laser expert Patrick Priebe  created a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm. And in a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away. Scroll down for video . Laser expert Patrick Priebe  built a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm (pictured lighting a match) The gadget was created by Wuppertal-based Mr Priebe, who designs and builds metal laser gadgets to order online. He posts videos to YouTube as AnselmoFanZero. His Laser Gloves and Laser Gauntlet/Arm are  available to order in varying wavelengths. Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside . A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. These range from the blue 405nm-type laser model to one fitted with 445nm, or 650nm. He also offers a 'low power green' version on his website. The gadgets are powered by Lithium-ion cells and output ranges between 0.2W and 1.2W. Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand, or both. He has previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and  a built-in laser pointer. The rechargeable watch has an LED watch module and 1,500-milliwatt laser. Earlier this year, the same German inventor built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said that although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside. A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall.

Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and it can be made for either the left or right hand, or both . The glove was inspired by Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured) Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands, too, as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'. The laser weapon is a taken on the iconic Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in the 1860s. Mr Priebe  previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and built-in laser pointer (shown) Mr Priebe admitted  the watch was a ‘pain in the a’ to make because of all the tiny parts, and the total watch took him around 40 hours to complete. The watch is pictured popping balloons on a wall . The laser watch was inspired by 1964 Bond film Goldfinger. In this scene, Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fröbe) ties James Bond (Sean Connery) to a table and threatens to cut him using the laser pointer (pictured) In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. Tony Stark's original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. ‘That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,’ said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. The American Chemical Society in Washington recently explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looked at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explained the science behind super-healing abilities . This is ‘strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,’ she said. ‘There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn’t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.’ None of this would work, though, without Stark’s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern.\n",

            "Ahead of the 79th edition of the Masters, Sportsmail counts down the 20 greatest shots ever seen at Augusta National Golf Club. Here are Nos 20-11. Mark O'Meara celebrates his winning putt in 1998 . 20 Mark O'Meara, 1998 . Aged 41, Mark O'Meara's chances of a major championship appeared to have gone despite a fine career and many victories on the PGA Tour. But O'Meara shot two birdies in three holes from the 15th on Sunday and a good approach into the 18th left him with a 20-footer to beat David Duval and Fred Couples. In the manner of his great friend Tiger Woods, he drained it. And he was soon handed his green jacket by Woods in the Butler Cabin. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . 19 Billy Joe Patton, 1954 . Billy Joe Patton came within a stroke of perhaps the biggest Masters shock of all but narrowly missed out on a play-off with Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. But for a short while it had appeared that an amateur golfer could topple two of the greatest ever to play the game, thanks to his hole-in-one on the par-three sixth on Sunday. Sadly, Patton's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly Rae's Creek and reach the green in two. Otherwise his ace would have featured near the very top of this list. Billy Joe Patton hits on the 13th hole... the scene of the double-bogey which ultimately cost him victory . CLICK HERE for the second part of our countdown, featuring videos of shots from the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods... 18 Seve Ballesteros, 1983 . Seve's second Masters victory featured what he called 'the best golf of my life' over the first four holes, and one 205-yard 2-iron on the fourth was utterly spectacular. But nothing quite sums up the genius of the late, great Spaniard than the way he clinched his four-shot victory over Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw. An up and down for a bogey would have comfortably sewn up his victory, but showman Seve was having none of it and chipped in for a par four. 17 Byron Nelson, 1937 . Byron Nelson found himself a somewhat daunting six shots behind Ralph Guldahl in the final round of the 1937 tournament. But his comeback was complete on the par-five 13th after he found the cup with a chip for eagle from off the green, while his rival could only manage bogey. Lord Byron came from four strokes down to two ahead in just 25 minutes, and went on to win the first of his five majors by that same margin. Byron Nelson and club member Alfred Bourne at the presentation ceremony in 1937 . 16 Vijay Singh, 2009 . OK, so this isn't actually during the Masters itself, but have you ever seen anything like it? The big Fijian won the green jacket in 2000 but may not have hit a finer shot than this one during the annual par-three tournament on the Wednesday before the 2009 edition. Vijay skimmed his ball across a lake and watched as it rolled onto the green and into the cup for an ace. You'll need to see it to believe it. 15 Nick Faldo, 1989 . With dark descending, in dank drizzle and with wind whipping the course, Nick Faldo became only the second Briton ever to win the Masters after a play-off with Scott Hoch. His nerveless approach over the water on the 11th hole was good, but the putt was even better. Faldo recalled how his caddie, Andy Prodger, told him it was too dark to see the line of the shot, but he stroked it pure and right into the heart of the cup. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT . Nick Faldo celebrates his brilliant putt to win the Masters in a play-off in 1989 . 14 Charl Schwartzel, 2011 . Charl Schwartzel's victory three years ago is most famous for his rip-roaring finish - four birdies in the final four holes sealed his first major title - but his start was no less incredible. After missing the first green, the South African somehow chipped in from 100 feet for a remarkable birdie. And then, on the third, he slam-dunked his approach from the fairway for an eagle two. Two incredible shots, but the gods truly were smiling on Schwartzel that day. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . Charl Schwartzel (right) is presented with his green jacket by Phil Mickelson in 2011 . 13 Phil Mickelson, 2004 . Phil Mickelson had long carried the burden of being known as 'the best player never to have won a major' - just ask Lee Westwood how wearisome that feels. Lefty had a string of near-misses behind him - six second and third places - when he went toe-to-toe with Ernie Els over the back nine at Augusta that Sunday. And it all came down to the final green as Phil the Thrill sank an 18-footer for birdie under huge pressure to cast off that unwanted reputation once and for all. 12 Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 . Imagine playing in your very first Masters... and standing over a putt to win, in a sudden-death play-off. It was the first time the Masters had been decided in such a way, was played in the gathering gloom and also included Ed Sneed and the great Tom Watson. In near darkness, Zoeller held his nerve to sink his birdie putt on the 11th hole and make history. 11 Louis Oosthuizen, 2012 . Some might argue that this is the best shot in Masters history - but some would also say it wasn't even the best shot of the day (see the countdown from 10-1). Whatever, it's hard to think of a more perfectly envisioned, controlled and executed long iron in the history of the game. Oosthuizen catapulted himself into the lead (and an eventual play-off) with this 253-yard approach into the par-five second hole that pitched on a sixpence at the front of the green. From then on, it was never going anywhere other than the centre of the cup. Louis Oosthuizen raises his arms and soaks it all in after holing out for an albatross at Augusta in 2012 .\n",

            "Lukas Podolski insists he is prepared to fight for his place at Arsenal when he arrives back at the club in the summer. The German World Cup winner is currently on loan at Inter Milan having joined the Serie A club in January following a tough start to the season at the Emirates, where he scored just three goals in 13 appearances. The move to Italy appeared to signal the end of Podolski’s time in north London, but the 29-year-old is adamant he still has a role to play in Arsene Wenger’s side. Inter Milan loanee Lukas Podolski says he wants to play for parent club Arsenal next season . The German forward has yet to score since arriving in Serie A in January . ‘When I go back (to Arsenal) I think I have the chance to play there,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I have one year left so well will see what happens. I feel very well at the club and with my teammates as well. I had a great two and a half years; I scored a lot of goals there and had a lot of assists. ‘The first six months of the season were not easy, that’s why I changed clubs. But now I’m ready.’ Arsenal made it to back-to-back FA Cup finals over the weekend thanks to an extra-time win over Reading and Podolski tweeted his congratulations to his parent club, although he admitted he hadn’t seen the action. The forward was busy preparing for the derby with Inter against rivals Milan, but he was left on the bench by Roberto Mancini for the second game running as the sides played out a 0-0 stalemate. Podolski struggled for first-team opportunities in north London before leaving the Gunners on loan . Podolski has failed to score in 12 appearances since arriving in Italy, but he says there is no frustration over the lack of time he’s getting on the pitch. ‘It’s not a problem for me. I’ve been in this business of playing football long enough,’ he said. ‘Of course I want to play every game but it’s the decision of the coach, he makes the decision and picks the first XI and when he thinks the players on the pitch are better than me or in better form than me then they have to play. ‘I’m ready, I’m fit, I want to play because a derby is always a great game and it’s for these types of matches you play football. ‘I’m here now to finish the season then I have two games with the national team, then we will see.’ Podolski celebrates with Alexis Sanchez after scoring the winner against Anderlecht in October .\n",

            "(CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \"cowardly act.\" \"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.\n",

            "While young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely, it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves. Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory. They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda, the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing. Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda (above) have learned to look for traffic . Scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads, while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely. It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads. Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs, researchers have suggested. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. Marie Cibot, a biologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, who led the work, said the spread of road infrastructure in Africa was posing a growing threat to wildlife in many countries. She said: 'Although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals, chimpanzees took into account this risk. 'More than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing. 'Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups. Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups.' The researchers say the road in Sebitoli sees around 89 motor vehicles an hour racing down it at speeds of between 40mph and 60mph. The researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year. However, chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses. They watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years. They found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed. Adult chimps, like this one, tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely . Females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently. Around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely. They also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time. Chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads. However, on quieter roads, adults tend to lead the group in a similar way as they do when checking for predators rather than splitting up into smaller groups. The researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, have appealed for measures to help reduce the impact roads were having on wildlife. Miss Cibot, who worked on the study with Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Great Ape Conservation Project in Uganda, said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe. The team are hoping to work with the Ugandan authorities to test new safety measures. Miss Cibot said: 'These observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human-impacted habitats. 'Further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories. 'Mitigation measures, like bridges, underpasses, reduced speed limits, speed-bumps, signposts, or police controls, should be established in this area.'\n",

Harry Kane has hailed his trailblazing few days as the ‘best week of my life’ after captaining Tottenham . That came after he scored within seconds of his England debut against Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley . It has been a fairytale season for the 30-goal striker, and he can’t quite believe the impact he has had. ‘Yes you could say it has been the best week of my life - to score, to make my first start and score for England, and to be captain,’ he said. ‘It has been an unbelievable couple of weeks and one I won't forget for the rest of my career. ‘It's a huge honour and to lead the lads out was a very proud day for me just a shame we couldn't get the win.’ At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley . Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in their 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Sunday . Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted that their Champions League aspirations now look all but over after they failed to break a gallant Burnley down at Turf Moor. ‘It was a very tough game,’ he said. ‘We fought a lot. The second half was good but not enough to win the game. ‘I'm pleased with a clean sheet but we've dropped two points.

            "Her neighbour’s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and, says Audrey Alexander, has left parts of her garden in deep shade. What’s more, it now seems likely to remain that way. Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size, the council has ruled they can stay. It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander’s family. It kicked off 35 years ago when Mrs Alexander’s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour's massive hedge . Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. She claims Mrs Robinson refused and declared: ‘I would rather move than touch these trees.’ The dispute rumbled on, with Mrs Alexander, 54, claiming that the trees knocked £20,000 off the value of her property. She sensed an opportunity, however, with the passing of the High Hedge Act in Scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases. Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked £20,000 off the value of neighbour Audrey Alexander's house (pictured) The situation came to a head in 2008, when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour's garden shed . Audrey Alexander (pictured) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made ‘no difference’. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. Complainants and the hedge's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort. Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear, disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached. The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice, which orders owners to cut the hedge back, or decide not to act. The local authority cannot make any orders about the roots of the hedge. She added: ‘The whole situation is appalling – the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight. ‘It’s a disgrace and I feel extremely let down.’ The neighbour refused to comment. Mrs Alexander’s only option is the courts which she cannot afford to do. Over the years she had used the mediation services of Stirling District Council to try to resolve the issue. The situation came to a head in 2008, when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell, demolishing a neighbour’s garden shed. Following the introduction of the High Hedge Act, Stirling Council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling. Dr Colin Watson, of Scothedge, a group which demands the end of ‘high hedge tyranny’, said that the council’s decision was ‘pretty crazy’. A council spokesman said the decision was made ‘after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence’. Mrs Alexander said her aunt, now 87, had moved to France to enjoy ‘sunshine and gardening’. Ms Alexander called in Stirling District Council to try to solve the quarrel, but no solution could be found and the feud continued . The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft, a height which Ms Alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .\n",

            "The baby boom generation is set to leave one last burden to its children and grandchildren – a wave of funeral debt. The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ A 'simple' funeral with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker now costs £3, 590 . Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.\n",

            "It has been almost 90 years since the electricity pylon as we know it was introduced into the UK. Thousands of the 165ft towers line the land, spoiling scenes of beauty with a cat’s cradle of high-voltage cables. But their days are numbered after a more elegant design was seen in action for the first time yesterday – complete with a pair of distinctive ‘earrings’. Scroll down for video . National Grid has revealed the UK's first new pylon for nearly 90 years. Called the T-pylon (artist's illustration shown) it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons. But it is able to carry just as much power - 400,000 volts. It is designed to be less obtrusive and will be used for clean energy purposes . National Grid is building a training line of the less obtrusive T-pylons at their Eakring training academy in Nottinghamshire. Britain's first pylon, erected in July 1928 near Edinburgh, was designed by architectural luminary Sir Reginald Blomfield, inspired by the Greek root of the word ‘pylon’ (meaning gateway of an Egyptian temple). The campaign against them - they were unloved even then - was run by Rudyard Kipling, John Maynard Keynes and Hilaire Belloc. Five years later, the biggest peacetime construction project seen in Britain, the connection of 122 power stations by 4,000 miles of cable, was completed. It marked the birth of the National Grid and was a major stoking of the nation’s industrial engine and a vital asset during the Second World War. There are now more than 88,000 pylons in the UK, including 22,000 on National Grid’s main transmission network in England and Wales. These stand some 50 metres high, weigh around 30 tonnes and carry up to 400,000 volts of electricity over thousands of kilometres to some of the most exposed, weather-beaten parts of Britain. Each T-pylon measures about 115ft (35 metres) tall - about a third shorter than the old pylons, which were about 165ft (50 metres) tall. The design is a T-shape, with two ‘hanging baskets’ either side holding the various wires and cables needed to transmit electricity. T-pylons were the winners of a 2011 design competition to develop a new pylon that could deal with changing sources of electricity - namely, greener sources such as wind and solar power. ‘We’ve been able to answer \"yes\" to the hundreds of questions that need to be asked before we can introduce a new type of pylon,’ said David Wright, Director of Electricity Transmission Asset Management at National Grid. ‘The training line has enabled us to learn so many lessons about how to manufacture and build the T-pylon. ‘I’m incredibly proud of the high standard of engineering that brought us to this point.’ Despite being shorter, the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight. The simplistic design, composed mostly of just eight components, means new T-pylons can be erected in just a single day, rather than a whole week for older pylons. National Grid is building a training line of six T-pylons at their Eakring training academy in Nottinghamshire .

Maintenance is also easier, as engineers do not need to climb the pylons, but can simply work on them from an elevated platform. The new pylons won’t replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use; rather, the National Grid will use them separately. National Grid plans to use the first operational T-pylons with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. ‘We developed the new type of pylon so that we could have a 21st century design to offer as we plan new transmission routes,’ added Mr Wright. ‘The T-pylon is not a replacement for the steel lattice pylon but it’s a new option and in some landscapes its shorter height and sleeker appearance can offer real advantages.’ The new pylons won’t replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use; rather, the National Grid will use them separately. They plan to use the first T-pylons with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset .

            "New aerial photos show the trail of destruction a tornado inflicted on a small Illinois farming community. Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could. But buildings in the settlement were virtually flattened when the vortex slammed into the area at around 7pm on Thursday night. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way. Geraldine M Schultz, 67, and Jacklyn K. Klosa, 69, were killed in her home by the storm, authorities announced, while around a dozen people were injured. This aerial photo shows a path of destruction, after a tornado swept through the small town of Fairdale, Illinois . Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could . The DeKalb County Sheriff's Office bused residents back to the scene of the devastation so they could begin to take stock of what was left of their property. Seeing the wreckage up close for the first time since Thursday's storms left some amazed that they survived. 'I thought my parents were dead,' said 32-year-old Adam Davis, who hopped into his truck Thursday and raced along with the tornado in the hopes of getting to his parents' house and rescuing them before the twister struck. He found them standing in their doorway frozen in disbelief and grabbed them just in time. On Saturday, he was helping collect what could be salvaged from his childhood home, now full of debris, its roof ripped off and its windows broken. 'It's not necessarily the mementos yet; it's the essentials for now. One step at a time,' he said. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms, the National Weather Service confirmed Saturday. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people. Debris surrounds a plot where a house once stood in the farming community. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way . The weather service gave it a preliminary EF4 rating — its second strongest — with winds of between 180 and 200 mph. It was a half-mile wide and remained on the ground for at least 28.7 miles, a record long path for that part of Illinois. Al Zammuto, a 60-year-old machinist, was preparing to inspect what was left of the roof on a former schoolhouse that he had been transforming into his home over the past year. He will have to start over. 'I don't know how much of the roof came off,' he said. 'I'm going to climb a ladder later today and see.' In all, some 70 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Fairdale, authorities said. Another 50 buildings were hit in nearby Rochelle. All buildings have been searched, but not all residents have been accounted for, so cadaver dogs are being used in parts of DeKalb County, the Illinois State Police said late Friday. The tornado blew numerous vehicles from nearby interstates, and troopers helped rescue a trapped driver in an overturned semi-trailer. As the cleanup began, tales of survival continued to emerge. The vortex created a path through the fields and wiped out a house as it made its way to the town. A building is left standing in a property above . Kelly Newman, 46, lost her Rochelle home. For her, the storm began with a moment of playful wonder at the size of the hail. She ran outside to collect some of the pieces to put it in the freezer to show her children. 'Then I noticed to the southwest there was a huge black funnel thing, but it didn't look like a tornado because it was just way too wide,' she said. But the telltale train-like roar sent them and their 19-year-old daughter running for the basement.

            "Kellie Maloney, pictured at Ukip's spring conference in February, now says that a vote for the party is 'wasted' Kellie Maloney has said that a vote for Ukip is a wasted vote. The celebrity former boxing promoter, formerly known as Frank, is one of the party's most famous former candidates. But she warned Ukip supporters should vote Tory to keep Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon out of power. She told Sky News: 'If we want to stop Labour and the SNP I think you’ve got to vote Tory. A vote for Ukip would be quite wasted I believe. 'I know Ukip are not going to like hearing that, but if they’re honest they would say the same things as well because they’re not going to get enough seats to wield any power. 'I think they’ll get four or five seats, maybe.' She praised Ukip leader Nigel Farage, adding: 'You can’t knock him.' But she warned how other candidates have given the party a bad image. She said: 'There is free speech (in the party) but some of the stuff that comes out from some of the Ukip people. 'I mean no normal person in the street could accept that and I think that is their downfall. 'They could offer some great things to the British public had they sat down and done it right and they weeded out the bad and brought in more people through the ranks.' The former boxing promoter, who stood as the party's candidate for London Mayor in 2004, has just undergone a full gender re-assignment. Speaking about transgender people, she said: 'We are probably where the gay community was 25 years ago and we can learn a lot from them. 'But it would be nice to hear political parties speak up on civil rights and gender issues.' Mr Farage last night dismissed the criticism. He told Sky News: 'There is a fear about Labour and the SNP and that’s why I’m talking to you from Hartlepool because whats happened over the last couple of weeks is there is a strengthening in the Ukip polls and its all coming from Labour. 'So the way to stop Labour/SNP coalition is for Labour voters to switch and vote for Ukip.' When Miss Maloney was standing to London Mayor, she caused controversy by claiming there were 'too many gays' in Camden. She apologised for the homophobic remarks when she addressed Ukip's spring conference in February this year. The criticism is a blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage who had hoped that Miss Maloney's backing would help to change the image of the party . Mr Farage will today campaign in Hartlepool, where he thinks the party has its best chance of winning in the North East at the election. The seat has been put on Ukip’s list of top ten targets. Other seats outside of the south of England on the list are Great Grimsby, Boston & Skegness, Dudley North and Heywood & Middleton. Mr Farage last night said he believed Ukip could 'smash up' Labour's 'one-party state' in the North. In an article for MailOnline he said Mr Miliband's party 'simply do not understand' the impact mass immigration has had on people's lives. He accused shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna of calling Ukip racist because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Ukip’s strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the North. In 2010 the party failed to achieve even a single second place. The Hartlepool constituency has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974. In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour’s Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage’s hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as ‘H'Angus the Monkey’, Hartlepool United FC’s mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, ‘free bananas for schoolchildren’. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy.\n",

            "Tokyo (CNN)A second robotic probe sent into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an \"unprecedented\" experiment. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, Japan and Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.\n",

            "Miami (CNN)Inside a plane at Miami International Airport, baggage handlers are going on a shopping spree with passengers' bags. What they don't know is that they are being recorded on a hidden camera. The Miami-Dade Police Department set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. \"It's a problem we all face,\" said police Lt. Pete Estis. \"We will continue to be proactive until we can see that the claims of pilfering through luggage will actually decrease.\" Miami Aviation Director Emilio T. González said the insider theft cases \"are indeed the exception among the thousands of decent, hardworking employees at MIA, and they have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for their crimes.\" And these insider thefts just don't happen in Miami. A CNN analysis of passenger property loss claims filed with the TSA from 2010 to 2014 shows 30,621 claims of missing valuables, mostly packed in checked luggage. The rest occurred at security checkpoints. Total property loss claimed: $2.5 million. John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York topped the list of airports with the most claims of thefts from luggage, followed by Los Angeles International, Orlando International and Miami International, according to the data. The problem has been so serious at JFK that in 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera in a baggage hold. The camera showed baggage handlers stealing items on flights bound for Israel, including a $5,000 Seiko watch, iPhones, an iPad, cameras, gold rings and cash. Six of those arrested pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property or petty larceny and the seventh suspect's case was sealed, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office. The high-profile case, though, didn't stop the thefts. Two more baggage handlers at JFK were arrested in 2014 after authorities said they stole two designer handbags from a suitcase, and then tried to sell them on eBay. Then, in December, seven more JFK baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables from checked luggage. The items were stolen from suitcases of passengers traveling to or from Hawaii, Japan, Johannesburg, London, Bangkok, Dubai, Milan and various U.S. cities. In Miami, which aggressively goes after luggage thieves, police have arrested 31 baggage handlers and ramp workers since 2012, including six so far this year. Police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items. Another hidden camera caught a baggage handler rummaging through bags in a secure luggage room inside the airport while a security guard looked the other way. \"Insider threat is very scary for us in law enforcement, and certainly someone taking somebody's cell phone, iPad, computer -- what's next?\" Estis said. A CNN investigation earlier this year found that Miami and Orlando are the only two major airports in the country that require employees to be screened through metal detectors. Miami even checks employees when they leave work to go into the main terminal. But that apparently hasn't stopped the luggage thieves. \"As far as being able to get the property off the airfield, that's a great question,\" Estis said. \"We have theories.\" In Los Angeles, police last year executed search warrants on 25 locations after getting complaints about thefts in two terminals. Among the valuables found were computers, watches, jewelry and cameras and designer bags. Sixteen airport workers were fired. \"We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,\" said Patrick Gannon, police chief of Los Angeles International Airport. Luggage theft could definitely lead to more serious problems, he said. \"I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism,\" Gannon said. Even the TSA has had problem employees. Since 2002, the agency has fired 513 officers for theft. It employs about 50,000 officers today, and last year screened more than 443 million checked bags and nearly 1.7 billion carry-ons. DA: Guns smuggled on planes by Delta employee 'egregious' security breach . Luggage theft isn't confined to airport workers. Outsiders have been caught on surveillance cameras stealing luggage from carousels. CNN contacted airports around the country and found while the total thefts from carousels are relatively low, it continues to be a problem. For example, Seattle reported 214 luggage thefts from carousels and other airport locations last year, 200 in Las Vegas, 36 in Atlanta, 35 in Phoenix, 15 at Ronald Reagan Washington National, 14 at Dulles International and 10 at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

            "Those surprised at Yaya Toure's apparent desire to talk himself in to a transfer from Manchester City this week should not be. The Ivorian's CV tells the story of a player who has always placed pragmatism above sentiment when it comes to his choice of clubs. Toure, for example, left home as a teenager to play in the Belgian second division. Following that came some formative years playing for Metalurh Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. History also tells us that Toure, now almost 32, never stays in one place too long. Equally, though, Toure's rather clumsy statements of recent times should not be allowed to detract from his legacy at City and indeed in the Barclays Premier League. It looks likely Yaya Toure may leave Manchester City this summer but his legacy should be a positive one . Toure has struggled to impose himself upon games for City in the manner seen in previous seasons . Toure's time at City is defined as a success, bringing two Premier League titles to the Etihad . It looks extremely likely that he will leave England this summer. Toure has started to play and sound like an unhappy footballer, the social alliance he has formed with the Etihad's enfant terrible Samir Nasri hardly helping. If and when he does go, though, it is for his extraordinary contribution on the field – and not the unfortunate noise that has started to surround him - for which he should be remembered. At his club, Toure has been fundamental to City's transition from wealthy hopefuls to twice champions. Back in 2010, he arrived as a statement signing - a £24m fee and £1m a month – for a club determined to accelerate its own learning curve. It worked and, on a wider scale, he has simply been one of the most watchable footballers our league has ever seen in its modern form. I once asked a member of City's coaching staff if there was anybody quicker at the club than Micah Richards. He replied: 'Yes, Yaya. Not over the first few yards but when he gets going he is unstoppable. He's like a truck heading downhill without the brakes.' Premier League defenders would testify to that but there was always more to him. Toure possesses an intelligent football brain, the vision required of all top class central players and a sureness of touch. He has also had a demeanour that has allowed him the confidence to play just about anywhere on the field. This, remember, is a man who played as a central defender in a Champions League final against Manchester United. The first time he had ever played that position, he faced off with Cristiano Ronaldo as Barcelona won in Rome in 2009. 'We had a good team so it was not that hard for me that night,' Toure told this newspaper in December 2011. Toure (right) demonstrated his versatily by shackling Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2009 Champions League final . Midfield player Toure (left) signed for City for a fee of £24million from Barcelona in 2010 . Mark Hughes, the then City boss, begun a plan to sign Kolo Toure in an attempt to entice Yaya along . In that same interview, Toure admitted that he liked to listen to Whitney Houston in his car on the way to training. 'That other music makes my head hurt,' he laughed. A detail that had been leaked rather mischievously by his brother Kolo, it pointed to a relationship that went straight to the heart of Toure's presence at the Etihad Stadium. Though he didn't arrive at City until five summers ago, City's pursuit of Toure had actually started eighteen months earlier in the January window of 2009. Stunned by a home FA Cup defeat to Nottingham Forest, City's then manager Mark Hughes presented the club's board with a list of transfer targets. Toure, then in his Barcelona pomp, was on it and so, cleverly, was his brother. The plan was straight forward. Sign Kolo and maybe Yaya would follow. The two brothers – as close as could be – had always wanted to play together domestically and Kolo's subsequent recruitment from Arsenal in the summer of 2009 was the trigger for the arrival of Yaya a year later. Sadly for Hughes, sacked at Christmas later that year, he wasn't around to see his plan come together. Nevertheless, Yaya's arrival remains one of the pivotal moments in the development of the modern Manchester City. The plan worked, with both Ivory Coast players gradually signing, but Hughes had been sacked by then . Toure (left) is a quiet figure away from the field and refuted reports of a fall-out with Mario Balotelli . Toure (centre) led City to the Premier League title 2012 and inspired an important victory at Newcastle . Away from the field, the lumbering Toure has always been a relatively gentle soul. When he ordered a 50inch TV from a store in South Manchester soon after his arrival in the area, he was immediately told by wife Gineba to return it. It was simply too big – she said – which was interesting given that on the same day she had taken delivery of a dressing table with Swarovski diamonds embedded in the drawer handles. When, in April 2012, Toure was accused in print of arguing with Mario Balotelli during half-time of a game against Sunderland he invited Sportsmail to talk to him. 'I love Mario,' he said. 'I am going to take him on holiday to Africa.' That trip never took place but on the field Toure fulfilled the promises he made when he arrived. A winning goal in an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United in 2011 was followed by another, against Stoke City, in the final. City were up and running and when Toure scored from 30 yards at Newcastle a year later, a first Premier League title was on its way. For a while, he was almost unstoppable. Toure (left) also led City to FA Cup glory in 2011 with a decisive goal against United in the semi-final . Toure also scored City's winning goal against Stoke City in the FA Cup final in 2011 . Toure delivered the trophies that he was brought in to do and will be missed at City when he departs . This season, Toure has not been at his best. He has, at times, looked his age. His manager Manuel Pellegrini hasn't always helped by asking him to play as part of a holding two in midfield when it has been apparent for a while that he is now most effective as a modern day number ten, free of defensive obligations. City still win lots of games when Toure starts, though. They will miss him when he goes. The footprints he leaves behind will be deep ones.\n",

            "These shocking photographs reveal how a horse riding event for a cancer charity in Northern Ireland apparently used a surprise jump in the shape of a car. Dozens of animal welfare complaints have been made after a horse attempted to jump a black Peugeot 206 car with glass still in the windscreen at the event in Greencastle, County Tyrone. One animal can be seen crashing head first into the turf, dismounting a rider, after trying to scale the vehicle - a jump that could have seen it suffer deep wounds or even fatal broken legs. Shocking scene: Dozens of animal welfare complaints have been made after a horse attempted to jump a black Peugeot 206 car with glass still in the windscreen at the event in Greencastle, County Tyrone . Fall: One animal can be seen crashing head first into the turf, dismounting a rider, after trying to scale the vehicle - a jump which could have seen it suffer deep wounds or even fatal broken legs . A number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event on March 28. One rider reported visiting A&E to be treated for badly bruised ligaments after her horse fell. One complaint sent to welfare officers warned that ‘someone could have been killed’ at the event. It said: ‘The public were asked to attend a charity “hack” which is supposed to be a casual walk; trot through road or forest trails with your horse with an odd natural fence to jump – i.e. trees or ditches. ‘In reality some the horses were made jump extremely dangerous obstacles, one being a car with glass still within and over atrocious ground conditions which is nothing short of animal cruelty.' It added: ‘From these pictures some of these animals are clearly not fit enough to be partaking in any jumping activities, ridden by people who had no regard for the safety of them.’ The complainant said a friend had attended the event, believing it would be in a good cause for charity, but was ‘utterly shocked at what she witnessed, advising many horses were beaten’. ‘One particular horse left with the skin from his chest between his legs torn and hanging off,’ they added. ‘There was a flap of skin hanging down between the horse’s legs.’ Getting up: A number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event in Northern Ireland . The Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said today that complaints had been made after the horses were ‘exploited and abused’ in the ‘obviously dangerous’ event. A spokesman told MailOnline: ‘People have quite rightly felt the animals were being exploited and abused. Our point would be that the riders have the choice, but the horses don’t.’ Fermanagh and Omagh District Council - which has the power to prosecute, unlike the USCPA - said its animal welfare and agriculture officials are aware of the incident and are investigating. But Patricia Keenan, 34, who organised the event, said she had originally planned for the car to feature as a jump obstacle - but it was intended to be a 'photographic prop’ on the day. She told the Ulster Herald: ‘On the morning of the ride-out I had delegated a number of tasks, one of which was to close the pallets across the approach to the jump and hang a red flag on it. ‘Unfortunately due to time constraints and confusion within the delegated voluntary assistants, this instruction was not executed, with the unfortunate consequence that a few riders out of the entire field of 65 riders elected of their own will to deviate from the designated clearly marked route which involved a modest jump over a ditch.’ The charity supported by the race, Charis Cancer Care, said its trustees were not aware of the fundraiser - and would only comment on what had happened once it had investigated the matter.\n",

            "One of Suge Knight's alleged victims claims the rap mogul growled 'I'm going to kill you' then 'everything went black'. In his newly-released police interview obtained by TMZ, Cle 'Bone' Sloan tells officers Knight uttered the threat then yanked on the gear stick. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to Sloan by ramming over them in his pick-up truck. Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records, has denied killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan in a parking lot in Compton on January 18. Scroll down for video . Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) told police Suge Knight (right) growled 'I'll kill you' before 'everything went black'. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to kill Sloan by running over them . Terry Carter (pictured) was killed, allegedly by Knight, in the Compton parking lot on January 18 . Sloan describes how the pair exchanged blows at the scene in January. 'He's mixing it up, he's f***ing with us and I caught him real good. Then he said, \"I'll kill you\". 'That's when everything when black.' Speaking to an LAPD officer, he claims Knight appeared to be reaching for a gun on the passenger seat while moving the gear stick. 'I don't if he was trying to put it in park or if he was trying to leave... I don't know. 'He started really reaching... when he said \"I'm gona kill you\", I thought \"oh sh** he's got a gun\". 'After that that's when everything kind of turned into a dream. I don't know what happened after that.' The audio release comes after pictures emerged of Suge Knight showing he had virtually no facial injuries when he was arrested. Knight was punched a number of times during the deadly confrontation, but close-ups taken by detectives show he only had a slight black eye. The images were released along with a number of key pieces of evidence as the court was shown footage of the deadly incident in Compton on January 18 for the first time. The footage, which was played by the prosecutor for the first time, shows Suge Knight's pickup truck (top left) pulling up to the driveway of a burger stand in Compton on January 29 . Just seconds later, there is a confrontation between Knight Cle 'Bone' Sloan and Terry Carter. Knight runs over Sloan's leg and then plows into Carter . Sloan is then seen lying on the ground in the aftermath. A bystander then runs over to help . Los Angeles Superior Court also released an image of the truck the rap mogul was driving when he ran over the two men . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen reviewed the items before determining Knight, 49, should stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. The video shows Knight's pickup truck  pulling up to the driveway of the burger stand and Cle 'Bone' Sloan approaching the driver's side window. Sloan then approaches the driver's side window and punches the 49-year-old in response to a flurry of insults. Knight's pickup is seen backing up, throwing Sloan to the ground before the truck drives over his legs and then plows over Terry Carter - who died as a result. Among the other key pieces of evidence shown to the court were images of Knight taken immediately after his arrest. An hour-long interview with Sloan, who survived, describing what happened was also released. Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation in late January. Knight has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said Knight was fleeing an ambush by Sloan and others when he hit the men outside a Compton burger stand. The entire incident took approximately 30 seconds. The video, shot by a surveillance camera monitoring the drive-thru at the burger stand, continues until the arrival of a paramedic. The footage is likely to be used by both sides during Knight's trial. Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, has said the video appears to show an associate of Sloan's taking a gun off of him after he is run over, and jurors likely will be shown an enhanced version of the video. Knight turned himself in to authorities the morning after the incident. Detectives took pictures of him to try to show he did not have any serious injuries from the attack. Sloan's interview with detectives will also be crucial to the case since he is unlikely to repeat the lucid account of the event and his own actions that he gave investigators. In court on Monday, Sloan repeatedly said he didn't remember the incident and refused to identify Knight as the person who injured him, saying he didn't want . Another photo of the 49-year-old after he was detained was released by the court. Knight has pleaded not guilty to killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan. The close ups were intended to show the injuries he sustained from being punched in the face during the confrontation .

            "It was good while it lasted. Starbucks announced late Friday night that a computer outage that affected registers at 8,000 stores in the US and Canada, prompting baristas to give away free drinks, has now been resolved. The global coffeehouse chain said in an update on its site that stores are expected to open for 'business as usual' Saturday. The company said earlier the outage affected 7,000 stores in the US and 1,000 in Canada. It did not explain exactly what caused the outage, which began in the early evening on the East Coast and in the late afternoon on the West Coast. Scroll down for video . No coffee here: A Starbucks store closes Friday in Phoenix because of computer issues. Starbucks says a sales register computer glitch has disrupted sales at company-operated stores in the US and Canada . It's free! A nationwide shutdown of Starbucks' computer system Friday evening prompted baristas to give away free coffee . Excited Twitter users spread the word about the giveaway, sharing photos of the free-of-charge drinks . Happy customer: User Joshua Decker praised the fine service at a Starbucks store in Redmond, Washington while posing with his free beverages . Store No. 1: There were plenty of satisfied customers at Starbucks' first-ever store in Seattle . The company offered free drinks and baked goods to customers before saying stores that had not already closed for the evening Friday were closing early. Earlier in the day, a young barrista named Jaleel working at a Starbucks coffeehouse on 8th Street in Manhattan told Daily Mail their system went down at around 7.30pm. The computer glitch prevented staff from accepting credit cards or ringing up sales, but Starbucks workers at the East Village location were still accepting cash. Some people who were standing in line at around 8.30pm had their wallets in hand. At one point, Jaleel walked up to a middle-age man waiting to get his coffee and let him know that their system was down and they were unable to take credit cards. In response, the customer flashed several folded banknotes. Starbucks released a statement on its website saying the company is aware of the point-of-sale register outage in the US and Canada. Greed is good: This giddy Starbucks patron took full advantage of Friday's one-of-a-kind giveaway . Get it while it's free: For some fans of the popular coffeehouse chain, the joy proved short-lived. According to Twitter users, many Starbucks locations around the country closed their doors so as not to give away free products during the shutdown . 'We are actively working to resolve the outage and our stores will remain open and continue to serve our customers,' the statement read. 'The outage was caused by a failure during a daily system refresh. We apologize to our customers for any inconvenience or confusion and will update this statement once systems are back online. This outage also affects our Evolution Fresh and Teavana stores.' Twitter immediately lit up with messages from giddy Starbucks customers spreading the word about the impromptu coffee giveaway and sharing photos of their free-of-charge Frappuccinos, venti mochas and soy lattes. 'Got myself a breakfast sandwich & iced tea at #Starbucks for free just now to be fair, I did pay for a drink earlier this afternoon,' boasted user Karen Chu, from Los Angeles. Another LA resident by the moniker @octopuscandy bragged: 'Starbucks systems are down so I got my drink for free. Seems like all Starbucks are doing this. Be sure to tip the barista!' Twitter user iamgrant quipped: 'Who wants to go to Starbucks with me tonight? I'll buy.' But for some fans of the popular coffeehouse chain, the joy proved short-lived. Fans of the global coffeehouse chain expressed their gratitude for Friday's freebies on social media . Seattle TV reporter Alison Morrow took this photo of a throng of tourists swarming the Pike Place Starbucks location . According to reports from around the country, many Starbucks locations in places like Florida, Tennessee and Arizona closed their doors so as not to give away free products during the shutdown. The potentially costly tech snafu comes just one day after the Seattle-based global coffeehouse chain, which had 21,366 locations in 65 countries last year, posted record quarterly earnings with net revenues of $4.6billion. On Friday, Starbucks shares gained 4.4 pe rcent to $51.50 following the impressive quarterly results.

            "Louis van Gaal has revealed that he has spoken to Marouane Fellaini about keeping his cool when the Manchester United midfielder returns to Goodison Park on Sunday for the first time since his £27million move from Everton. Fellaini, who followed manager David Moyes to Old Trafford in the summer of 2013, is set for a more hostile reception than Juan Mata received at his old club Chelsea last weekend. The Belgium international became a symbol for the failure of the Moyes era but has turned his career around under Van Gaal and goes back to Merseyside as an established first-team player at United. Marouane Fellaini (second right) shares a joke with goalkeeper David de Gea during training on Friday . United are gearing up for a trip to Everton, and the game will be Fellaini's first return to his former club . Louis van Gaal has spoken to Fellaini about keeping his cool on his first return to Goodison Park . Asked about suggestions at Everton that Fellaini has a short fuse, Van Gaal said: ‘I have spoken with Fellaini because I know this. Fellaini is always dry in his answers. He said \"it’s a game\". Yes, but it’s a special game for you. I hope the fans shall receive him like the Chelsea fans received Juan Mata because I like that very much. I hope it’s like that. ‘I am always communicating with my players about philosophy, performance, attitude, behaviour, and maybe one or two aspects more. 'That is what I’m doing, not more than that. When players believe in you they want to convince me because every player playing for Manchester United has qualities. 'Also Marouane Fellaini has qualities and we want to let his qualities dominate in the team and that is what we are trying to do. I believe that we are doing that. That’s why his performances are better just now.’ United have confirmed that Rafael has been ruled out of the remaining five games of the season with a rib injury, and Van Gaal expects to be without Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind for the trip to Goodison after all four players missed the defeat at Chelsea.

Ander Herrera takes part in a training drill as his team-mates, and manager Van Gaal (right), watch on . Robin van Persie is not expected to return to the starting XI after his run-out for United's Under 21 side . Van Gaal insists that fellow Dutchman Van Persie (centre) must show his qualities in United's second team . ‘All the players are still injured,’ he said. ‘Only Blind maybe, it’s a question mark, can reach the game against Everton. Jones, Carrick and Rojo cannot play against Everton.’ Robin van Persie is unlikely to regain his starting place despite playing for the Under 21s against Leicester earlier in the week. The Holland striker was an unused substitute at Stamford Bridge, and Van Gaal said: ‘He has to train very hard and play in the second team and show his qualities again. Then I have to compare him with the positions he can play with the players in that position. It’s always the same.’ Juan Mata looks on during United's final training session ahead of their weekend trip to Merseyside .

United remain one point ahead of fourth-placed Manchester City in the race for Champions League places, and Van Gaal wants to finish in the top-three and avoid having to pre-qualify for the tournament this summer. ‘It’s better and your preparation for the new season is more easy. We set this goal because it was very difficult to reach the top four. We have discussed our goal with the board and the owners and they have set this goal. 'I am the manager and I have to achieve, but they have set this goal for me to achieve. I am always in a club to win the championship not the third or fourth position.

            "Nico Rosberg is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career. Sitting in an air-conditioned room away from the dry heat of the Bahrain paddock, he goes so far as to say this of Lewis Hamilton: ‘I know exactly how he is functioning. I understand him really, really well. All his attitudes. I can tell why he is doing whatever he is doing. Sometimes he annoys me. Some character traits.’ Go on, then, tell us what it is that gets under your skin. Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday . Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton . Hamilton has dominated Roberg this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign . ‘I don’t want to give details,’ says Rosberg, diplomatic to the core. At this point the door of the Mercedes hospitality area, in which Rosberg and I are sitting alone, opens fast and loudly. It is Hamilton invading the quiet of the interview. He turns to face the door he has just walked through and slammed shut, his head down, and shouts in an almost childlike way: ‘Phew, phew, man, it’s hot,’ deporting himself as if he is about to pass out from heat stroke. ‘You see...?’ says Rosberg, his eyebrows arched. The daunting task he faces against his extraordinary team-mate was made vividly clear under the lights in qualifying for Sunday’s Bahrain Grand Prix. Not only will he start behind Hamilton for the fourth consecutive race but behind the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, who is emerging as a putative title contender. ROSBERG'S CORNER . Keke Rosberg . The 1982 world champion attended pre-season testing with friends but rarely goes to races and does not give interviews. Nico said he got his father’s advice before the last race in Abu Dhabi but he generally gives his son space. Vivian Rosberg . Nico’s long-term girlfriend turned wife. She attends a few races, sometimes with a clutch of their long-standing friends, but is happy in the background. She works as an interior designer. Georg Nolte . A popular, mild-mannered former Bild sports journalist, who is Nico’s PR and Man Friday. Tony Ross . Rosberg’s race engineer. His attachment to Rosberg is such that he moved from Williams to Mercedes at the driver’s request. HAMILTON'S CORNER . Anthony Hamilton . Father is rarely seen at races since being dropped as Lewis’s manager but he is still the family patriarch. He established the business side of his son’s career and still controls elements of it. Niki Lauda . The Mercedes chairman is strictly neutral but has a vested interest in Hamilton being successful, having brought him to the team after telling the board he was the driver who could win them the title. Daniel ‘Spinz’ Forrest . Hamilton’s new travelling companion. A music producer, he looks after Hamilton’s social media output. Peter Bonnington . Hamilton’s race engineer. He did the same job for Michael Schumacher. Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second on Saturday. He is also separated from the Briton by 17 points. But even more separates them as people. Rosberg grew up the son of privilege. His father, Keke, was 1982 world champion. He was brought up in Monaco. He attended a smart international school there. He speaks five languages. But his life is the quiet life. Not for him the Hamilton whirl of red carpets and celebrity acquaintances in Los Angeles. He is not tattooed from chest to leg. While Hamilton courts fame, Rosberg’s dream evening finishes with him and wife, Vivian, staying in to watch an ‘educational documentary’, their yellow Labrador, Bailey, at their side. Family is important. He has known Vivian, an interior designer, since his teenage years. They make smoothies or ‘healthy’ pancakes when they home in Monaco or Ibiza. They gather fresh vegetables from their bio-garden. He relishes a bike ride to the beach for lunch. He loves his classic car — a light blue Mercedes 280SL Pagoda, as perfect as the day it was made in 1970. He bought it without Vivian knowing, but they both enjoy it now. He drives them through the sweeping mountain roads of southern France. Rosberg has a trait rare among modern Formula One drivers: a hinterland. He turned down a place at Imperial College to become a full-time racing driver. If he wins the World Championship this year he will do so with a book under his arm. He is the driver who never stops learning. Having married last year, he and Vivian are expecting their first child in August, during the sport’s summer break. ‘Typical German precision,’ he jokes. ‘I’m very excited and very lucky,’ he says. ‘I just hope it all goes well. There is a link between your personal life and your racing life, naturally.’ But we know he is a nice, intelligent chap, more settled in life than his rival. The point when it comes to winning the most prestigious title in motor racing is whether he has the capacity — the skill and cutting edge — to beat such an extravagant talent as Hamilton, who eclipsed him last year. Rosberg has failed to match Hamilton this season, raising the question whether he will go the way of Mark Webber, who fell away after making his Red Bull team-mate Vettel fight him for his first title. Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second in qualifying on Saturday . Jenson Button will start his 100th race for McLaren from last on the grid after his ailing machine again gave up on him during qualifying. It was the third time this weekend he had suffered a failure, the latest coming just four corners into his first lap. ‘It was a power cut,’ said Button. ‘I don’t know where it came from.' It is Rosberg who begins work with his engineers earlier and finishes later — and always turns up on time, unlike Hamilton — but genius sometimes makes its own rules. Raw talent is outstripping endeavour. As a barbecue was staged in a paddock here on Friday, he toiled in engineering meetings while the rest of us tucked in. He arrived after a brief stop in Dubai, relaxing and training, before heading to the track to face an inquisition. Why had he criticised Hamilton for slowing down seven days ago in China and thus imperilling Mercedes’ one-two finish? Rosberg answered in a relaxed and courteous manner. ‘Only today have there been millions of questions,’ he tells me once the wider interrogation was over. ‘Other than that I’ve had some distance from it all. I don’t think about it in terms of me getting under his skin or him getting under mine. For both of us it has been annoying to spend so much time on the topic. Hamilton and Rosberg pose together during their unveiling as Mercedes' new team in February 2013 . ‘Lewis and I are going through a difficult period. We cannot totally be friends. We go through ups and downs. We are only speaking when we need to but sometimes we have a laugh together. We have so much to do with each other. We karted together. We are here together. I am not an ice man, either. Things can get to me but I do not get angry. I am rational. You won’t catch me getting very emotional.’ The feud between the two has been running for a year, each upsetting the other in turn, a situation magnified because there has been nobody else with whom to scrap. If Ferrari seriously push their way into the championship contest, that might change somewhat. ‘There are so many experiences that I can build on,’ says Rosberg. ‘Even now when he has taken quite a few points off me and been on a winning streak, I think back to last year when I had my best run after he had won four in a row. Nico's father Keke (left) was also a famous racing driver and won the 1982 Formula One World Championship . ‘I like to push myself. I am not at my peak as a driver, though I am probably close to it. But I have the experience of how to set up the car and deal with the whole world of Formula One. The intra-team stuff, personal relations are helped by last year. It was so valuable.’ Rosberg was born 29 years ago in Wiesbaden, Germany to a German mother, Sina, and his famous Finnish father. He soon moved to Monaco and developed as European polyglot. His solid family background is the bedrock of his life. Hamilton said last year that Rosberg was not as hungry as him because of their different backgrounds, the former being from a council estate in Stevenage and the latter from a plutocrat’s playground. Fair? ‘I had it easy if you think of people who have money struggles in their lives. People reading this may think I had it easy. But I had my personal battles. Even making it to Formula One was not easy; it was a constant challenge and commitment. My whole life has taken a lot of sacrifice. ‘Some people say I am not strong enough to beat Lewis but I have as much belief as ever. I only wouldn’t believe I could beat him if I got to the end of the championship and I had lost. That is not what I want to happen and I am constantly learning to make sure it’s not what happens.’ Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel pipped Rosberg to second in qualifying on Saturday .\n",

            "Kyrie Irving scored 30 points in his playoff debut and LeBron James added 20 in his first post-season game with Cleveland in five years as the Cavaliers opened a run towards a NBA title with a 113-100 victory over the Boston Celtics on Sunday. Irving made five three-pointers and Kevin Love, another post-season rookie, had 19 points and 12 rebounds. It was Cleveland's first home playoff game since May 11, 2010, when the Celtics won Game 5 and James left the floor to some boos from Cavaliers fans. He departed for Miami two months later, but he's home now, all is forgiven and Cleveland are aiming to end a championship drought dating to 1964. Kyrie Irving scored 30 points in his playoff debut as Cleveland Cavaliers beat Boston Celtics 113-100 . LeBron James (left) chipped in with 20 points as the Cavs took a 1-0 lead in their best of seven-game series . Isaiah Thomas scored 22 points to lead the seventh-seeded Celtics. They will try to even the best-of-seven series in Game 2 on Tuesday night. Clippers point guard Chris Paul scored 32 points, and Blake Griffin added 26 points and 12 rebounds, as Los Angeles surged in the second half to beat the San Antonio Spurs 107-92 in their first-round playoff series opener. Jamal Crawford added 17 points for the Clippers, who met the defending NBA champions' challenge in a difficult post-season-opening match-up of two powers. Griffin threw down his usual array of roof-raising dunks, while Paul quarter-backed Los Angeles to an 18-point lead in the third quarter. Kawhi Leonard scored 18 points for the Spurs, who had won the opening game in their previous 11 playoff series. Tim Duncan had 11 points and 11 rebounds, but the Spurs couldn't rally from their hefty second-half deficit. Game 2 is on Wednesday night. Los Angeles Clippers' point guard Chris Paul (left) scored 32 points as they beat San Antonio Spurs . Blake Griffin (centre) added 26 points and 12 rebounds for the Clippers in their 102-97 win . In Atlanta, Kyle Korver scored 21 points, including five three-pointers, as the top-seeded Hawks held off the Brooklyn Nets 99-92 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference playoff series. The Hawks led nearly the entire game and pushed the margin as high as 16 points, but the Nets kept coming back. Finally, Jeff Teague dropped in a floater coming off the left wing, giving Atlanta a 95-89 lead. Joe Johnson missed a 3-pointer from the corner for Brooklyn, and Teague made a pair of free throws with just under a minute remaining to essentially seal it. Teague and DeMarre Carroll scored 17 points apiece. Game 2 is Wednesday night in Atlanta. Kyle Korver scored 21 points as Atlanta Hawks defeated Brooklyn Nets 99-92 on Sunday evening . The Memphis Grizzlies downed the Portland Trail Blazers 100-86 after reserve Beno Udrih scored 20 points in Game 1 of their Western Conference first-round series. Zach Randolph had 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Marc Gasol added 15 points and 11 rebounds. Mike Conley finished with 16 points and didn't play the fourth quarter. Jeff Green had 11. LaMarcus Aldridge led Portland with 32 points while taking more shots than anyone had ever taken against Memphis in the postseason, going 13 of 34. Damian Lillard added 14 points, shooting 5 of 21 overall and 0 of 6 beyond the arc. Nicolas Batum had 15 points. The Trail Blazers have lost five straight overall. Game 2 is Wednesday night.

            "Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T. Despite his newest models being nearly 90 years old, the businessman, from Buckinghamshire, is selling one every week, including to the TV and film industry who have used then in shows such as Downton Abbey. Mr Tuckett says his customers love the Model T - the first affordable mass-produced car - because they don't require need road tax or an MOT and are cheaper to maintain than a modern car, with each one selling for  around £10,000. Scroll down for video . Toot: Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett (pictured) has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T . Top of the range: This 1914 model is £24,750 and is one of around one a week sold by the Buckinghamshire dealer . Yours for £13,500: this 1917 Model T is on the market and like all the classic cars they don't require road tax or a MOT . Back to basics: Some of the vehicles need to have their headlamps lit by match, left, and right are the rudimentary pedals for braking, accelerating and changing gear . But with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast and some of his pre-1915 model have gas headlights still lit by a match. Mr Tuckett, 58, has customers who use them as wedding cars and even one that is used as a hearse. He discovered his passion for the model when he got a call from his great uncle, John Brazil, asking him to accompany him on the London to Brighton commercial run - an event for historic commercial vehicles. He had a Model T van, previously used for transporting sausages and pies to London, and Neil had driven it once in a field before he got behind the wheel in Hyde Park for the event. He continued maintaining the vehicle afterwards and his great uncle left the van to him when he died. The agricultural engineer started his own business in 1984 but when the work dried up a few years later, his team turned their attention to Model Ts.. Now they struggle to keep up with the demand at his garage in North Marston, Buckinghamshire, and sell the cars for around £10,000 each. Neil has about six himself and goes touring in them with other fans of the car. MODEL T . Made . 1908-1927 . Price (from) £125 . Top speed . 45mph (if going downhill with a following wind) Acceleration (0-60) Not possible . Number of gears . 3 (2 forward, 1 reverse) Added features . None . Seating capacity . 2-7 . Wheelbase . 100\" Engine type . 4 cylinder, 4 cycle, internal combustion gasoline engine . Horsepower . 20 . Steering . Not power-assisted . MPG (Miles Per Gallon) 20-25 . Fuel tank capacity . 10 gallons . Weight . 1,200lbs . 2015 FORD FIESTA . Made . 2015 . Price (from) £13,965 . Top speed . 120mph . Acceleration (0-60) 9.3 seconds . Number of gears . 6 (5 forward, 1 reverse) Added features . Air conditioning; beverage holders; CD player; AM/FM radio; rear window defroster; MP3 decoder . Seating capacity . 5 . Wheelbase . 98\" Engine type . 1.6L . Horsepower . 120 . Steering . Power-assisted . MPG (Miles Per Gallon) 28 . Fuel tank capacity . 12.4 gallons . Weight . 2,578lbs . Neil said: 'We're a niche market specialist and I've got about 100 years of man experience of Model Ts with my team. 'We do about one a week, 50 a year. They're coming in here as fast as I can fix them. There's about 3,000 in the UK and we look after a good proportion of those. 'It was a very popular car. At one point, half the cars in the world were Model Ts. They're affordable, usable and repairable, even though they are 100 years old. 'It's more leisurely than a modern car. Its cruising speed is 30mph, at 40mph you're starting to rattle and to hit 45mph you'd have to be going downhill with the wind behind you. 'But it's cheaper to maintain than a modern car. The insurance costs about £50 a year, you don't need road tax or an MOT and there are no major expenses. Alternative forecourt: Business is booming at Neil Tuckett's time warp garage in the heart of rural Buckinghamshire . Meticulous: Mr Tuckett sources his Ford spares from all over the globe and carefully puts the machines back together again. Behind the wheel: The second-hand car dealer says that beauty of the Model is how simple and enjoyable it is to drive . Sales pitch: Mr Tuckett says: 'They're like a giant meccano set really, and so beautifully simple and reliable they just won't let you down. You also don't require road tax or and MOT' 'There's probably 20 companies in the world making new parts for the Model T and about 80 per cent of Model Ts are new parts now, but they don't make new chassis. 'The main source of original parts is America, 14million were built there. The parts are all affordable and there's no electrics so little to go wrong. 'And everyone seems to remember them, they know what a Model T is. That's quite surprising after 100 years, it's an iconic car. 'They're lots of fun. I'm about to go to Scotland with a Model T4 group - there's ten of us touring for a week in the Outer Hebrides. 'I've seen a lot of the UK that I would never have seen if I wasn't driving an old car.' Thing of beauty: The Model T is an icon, but with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast . Germans may have invented the petrol engine, but it was Henry Ford, a Michigan-Irish farmer used his genius to realise its social potential. Ford said he had to invent his ‘gasoline buggy’ to escape the crushing boredom of his own life on the farm in the United States. The Model T was made from 1908 to 1927 and is generally regarded as the first affordable car. In total more than 15million were made. The first Model Ts were fairly expensive, about £500. But by the early 1920s, when millions were being produced, the price had dropped to about £125, which was roughly equivalent to the average annual wage. Ford was obsessed with efficiency: his production lines were inspired by the meat-packing yards of Chicago and it became the first mass produced car in the United states . His famous decree that customers could choose ‘any colour so long as it is black’ was not to limit consumer choice, but to reduce costs. In Ford’s day, freshly painted cars were left in the sun to dry. Black dried more quickly and was thus cheaper. By 1914, a Model T could be manufactured in 93 minutes and spare parts were all available through the Sears Roebuck mail-order catalogue for drivers to install themselves.\n",

            "The highly-anticipated Champions League quarter-final second leg clash between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid took place on Wednesday but that didn't bother Jose Mourinho as he watched Fulham Under 21s lose to former club Porto. On the same night that Madrid knocked out rivals Atletico and Juventus overcame Monaco, Mourinho chose Fulham's Motspur Park training ground to have his dose of live football. Joined by his son Jose Junior, who is on student terms with the Cottagers, the Chelsea manager was pitchside as Fulham suffered a disappointing defeat in the Premier League International Cup semi-final clash.

            "Between the bad behaviour and the bad advice, Raheem Sterling is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now. Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool’s offer of close to £100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £40million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player’s agent for his role in the England international’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers’ criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘Uncle Aidy’. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has ‘more kids than caps’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training — but denies a second child. But Sterling’s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. ‘As a young kid I had anger issues,’ Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up ‘in prison’ if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was ‘amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker’. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling’s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose ‘mentality’ was ‘his strongest attribute’. He also described him as ‘a coach’s dream’. Gallen also praised Sterling’s mother — Nadine is a nurse — for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘house parents’. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling’s value to Liverpool is earning roughly £6m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; £35,000-a-week compared with £150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling’s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club’s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘from the Kop’. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘agent is a ****’. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don’t take the dispute into the public arena if it’s not a pay rise you’re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward’s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘beautiful house’ back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?\n",

            "It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway, . But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night . Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback . Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern . Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto . Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova . And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League .\n",

            "A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out.  Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: ‘It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. ‘There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.’ Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend’s house but he and his friends didn’t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by ‘dodging’ the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the ‘pitch black’ and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade – also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .\n",

Peterson met with the NFL two weeks ago to discuss his reinstatement, and at that point things did not look good for the star running back. The Vikings claimed they wanted him back on the roster, and he was set to earn $12.75million for the upcoming season, but Peterson and his camp had taken issue with the team's chief operating officer, Kevin Warren.

            "Aviva Premiership club Gloucester will face a Rugby Football Union hearing after selecting lock Mariano Galarza for their league game against Sale Sharks last month. The RFU has said Galarza should have been ineligible for the match. In a statement, the RFU said: 'In the Aviva Premiership rugby match against Sale Sharks on March 29, Gloucester Rugby breached Aviva Premiership Rugby regulation 3.3(a) by selecting a player (Mariano Galarza) who did not hold effective registration for Gloucester Rugby. Mariano Galarza played for Gloucester against Sale Sharks despite the fact that he's ineligible . 'The case will be heard by an independent panel of Jeremy Summers, Bonike Erinle and Robert Horner on Monday, April 27.' Galarza was selected among Gloucester's replacements for a game that they lost 23-6 at the A J Bell Stadium. He went on as a 54th-minute substitute for Tom Savage. Gloucester currently lie ninth in the Aviva Premiership, and it is feasible that they could be hit by a points deduction. The west country club have three league games left - against Newcastle, London Irish and Bath - while they are also through to next week's European Challenge Cup final, when they will face Edinburgh at the Twickenham Stoop. The Aviva Premiership side now face the prospect of having points deducted for the misdemeanour .\n",

            "Sugar consumption: Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40 (file picture) If you’re feeling stressed in the office, a sweet tea or coffee can seem like the perfect pick-me-up. According to scientists, sugar consumption can suppress the hormone cortisol, which is released into the body when we are experiencing stress. Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40. Half the group were given sugary drinks at breakfast, lunch and dinner over 12 days, while the other half had drinks made with the artificial sweetener aspartame. The volunteers were instructed not to consume other sugary drinks, including fruit juice, outside these times. Before and after the study period, the women were given a difficult maths test and then underwent MRI scans to measure the response of their brains to stress. Saliva samples were also used to measure levels of cortisol, which is made by the adrenal glands. The women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks. Dr Kevin Laugero, one of the researchers at the University of California, Davis, said: ‘This is the first evidence that high sugar consumption – but not aspartame – may relieve stress in humans.’ Finding: Scientists at the University of California, Davis (above) said the women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks . However, while research shows sugary drinks can help to dull feelings of anxiety, experts warn that too many of them could be habit-forming – and may explain the desire to comfort eat under pressure. Dr Laugero, whose findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, warned that chronic stress could prompt people to make a habit of consuming too much sugar, which is not recommended due to its links to health problems. He said: ‘The concern is that psychological or emotional stress could trigger the habitual overconsumption of sugar and amplify sugar’s detrimental health effects, including obesity.’ In the US, more than a third of adults and about a sixth of children are obese, with sugar-laden fizzy drinks and fruit juice partly to blame. Around half of the American population consume sugary drinks on any given day. Dr Laugero added: ‘The results suggest differences in dietary habits may explain why some people under-react to stressful situations and others over-react. ‘Although it may be tempting to suppress feelings of stress, a normal reaction to stress is important to good health.’\n",

            "A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.\n",

            "The Residence: Inside The Private World Of The White House . by Kate Andersen Brower . (Harper £18.99) For Americans, the White House is as iconic and royal a palace as you can get. For non-Americans, it is a respected power symbol,but not one to be especially loved. Kate Brower, an American journalist assigned to cover the Obama White House, became intrigued by the workings of the mansion after watching Downton Abbey.She set about interviewing the staff, who number at least 100, to build up a comparable picture of the American version of Upstairs, Downstairs. The staff all live out in Washington and commute in. The hours are long. Those on duty cannot go home until the President retires and goes to bed. So they see little of their families and are often divorced as a result. The pay is not great, but the job is prestigious and passed by personal recommendation among friends. Most of them have stayed there for 20 years or more. Ronald Reagan (pictured with his wife, Nancu) , on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours . The West Wing is the President’s office quarters; the East Wing belongs to the First Lady and her office staff. ‘The Residence’, as the living quarters are called, really begins on the second floor and is kept hidden from the hundreds of tourists who parade through the state rooms every afternoon. Keeping the organisation running smoothly, from the workshops in the basement to the snipers on the roof, is a complex operation. It costs money — $13 million a year from government funds, plus a hefty contribution from the First Family itself. Presidents and their wives have to pay for their own food and drink and that of their personal guests. They are also charged for dry-cleaning. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, especially in the kitchens where top chefs are above such considerations as cost. Jackie Kennedy was heard to complain: ‘We haven’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers’; while the Carters even asked the kitchen to serve them leftovers for their personal meals. The White House is never untenanted. The changeover of President takes place at 12 noon on Inauguration Day. Between then and 5pm, the entire moving out and in of the two families and their respective belongings has to be completed. The staff include ushers, chefs, maids, doormen, engineers, plumbers, full-time florists (the flower bill is enormous), even calligraphers who are kept busy writing invitations in fine script. But the glory of the place is its corps of butlers — six of them full-time, plus dozens more called in for big receptions, parties and dinners. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, Jackie Kennedy (pictured with her John F Kennedy) was heard to complain: ‘We haven’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers’ Most, by tradition, are black. There is a picture of ten of them taking a break between courses in their black ties. What is the collective noun for such a fine body of men? A bevy of butlers? The Kennedys and the Clintons liked staying up late and entertaining until 2am, which meant that those on duty didn’t get home until much later than that. This didn’t go down well. Oddly enough, the best-liked couple were the older Bushes — George H. W. and his wife, Barbara, who were used to having plenty of servants and were relaxed and genuinely concerned about them. The black staff, especially the elderly butlers who remembered segregation, are especially proud to serve the Obamas as the first black presidential family. One found Obama and his wife, Michelle, celebrating gaining The White House on their first night there with an impromptu dance to a record by Mary J. Blige. And yet the Obamas have turned out to be rather reserved and distant with the staff — even, says one, ‘stand-offish’. Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours. He had a disconcerting habit of sitting around naked reading the newspapers. His wife, Nancy, by contrast, was a martinet who collected Limoges china. Woe betide anyone who broke a piece. She would call a servant to say that the lights needed turning on when the switch was within easy reach. When she was going to be difficult about the meal service, which was frequently, she would send for the chef, cock her head on one side and smile — and then find fault, usually with the desserts served by chef Roland Mesnier. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons (pictured) used to share a bedroom — until the Lewinsky scandal - when Bill was relegated to the sofa in the study for a matter of time . Once, she decided at the last moment that the dessert for a state dinner should be sugar baskets each containing three sugar tulips. Chef Roland objected: ‘But there are only two days left until the dinner!’ She cocked her head: ‘Roland, you have two days and two nights before the dinner.’ Richard Nixon installed a bowling alley in the basement. He used to wander into the kitchens for a chat and discovered a washer-up who was also a keen bowler. They went on playing until 2am. Nixon then wrote a note to the man’s wife to explain why he was so late home. The Carters made news by appointing a convicted murderess as nanny to their daughter, Amy. Rosalynn Carter was convinced she was innocent, and the first family’s confidence was justified when the verdict was reversed. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons used to share a bedroom — until the Lewinsky scandal reached its height in 1998. For three or four months, Hillary made Bill sleep on a sofa in a study attached to the bedroom. Most women on the staff thought he’d got what he deserved. The feuding Clintons were the talk of the staff, who overheard their bad language and the sound of objects being thrown in bedrooms. Hillary’s voice screaming ‘Goddam bastard!’ was followed by a heavy thud. Much blood was discovered all over the bed. No one believed that her husband, who needed several stitches, had walked into a bathroom door in the dark, as he explained. ‘We’re pretty sure she clocked him with a book,’ said one member of staff. There were certainly plenty to hand — there were at least 20 on the Clintons’ bedside tables, including the Bible. But the biggest disturber of the peace was the huge bully from Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded the assassinated J. F. Kennedy. He gloried in his size (6 ft 3 in) and his achievements. He had TV sets installed everywhere and kept several on loudly as he watched himself in the newscasts. He undressed in front of the staff and gave them instructions while sitting on the lavatory, whose seat had to be replaced with a bigger one when he broke it. He drove the plumbers to nervous breakdowns over his shower. It was never hot enough nor strong enough for him. They replaced one after the other until the water came out as if from a fire hose and the heat generated set off the fire alarm. One water jet had to be aimed precisely at his penis (which he called ‘Jumbo’) and another up his rear end. He raged at the plumbers until he got satisfaction. Such was the man who escalated the Vietnam War.\n",

            "A Florida man believed to be high on Flakka, a designer drug stronger than crystal meth, attacked a police officer after being shocked with a Taser twice while claiming he was God, police said. Police were called after Kenneth Crowder, 41, was seen by a witness on Friday running naked through a neighborhood calling himself God. He was also spotted committing an undisclosed sex act on a tree. Crowder was arrested in Melbourne, facing charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer. Kennth Crowder was arrested in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday after being spotted running naked through a neighborhood claiming he was God . When police arrived on scene, he had put on jeans and a T-shirt and walked toward the officer in an aggressive manner as he called himself God, police told WKMG. A police officer shocked him with a Taser twice, but each time he pulled the probes out of his body and attempted to fight the officer. The officer then punched Crowder in the face and he fought back, claiming he was Thor and attempting to stab the officer with his own police badge. More officers eventually came to the scene and helped handcuff and shackle Crowder. He was booked into Brevard County Jail Complex and later posted bond to be released. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances like marijuana, is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP. That's the synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone, the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Crowder was arrested on charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer . Flakka resembles a mix of crack cocaine and meth and it has a noticeably foul smell, according to WPBF 25 News. Once ingested, the drug causes a feeling of euphoria, hallucinations and sometimes psychosis or apparent superhuman strength. The high lasts for a couple hours and users are left with a strong desire to use again. Users have nicknamed the drug '$5 insanity' because hits often cost less than $10, according to the Sun-Sentinel. There were more than 670 Flakka occurrences in Florida in 2014, up from 85 in 2012 and zero in 2010, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n",

            "(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are \"conscientious objectors,\" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new \"no jab, no pay\" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. \"The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,\" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. \"It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,\" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.\n",

            "Doctors solved the mystery behind an Arkansas man's kidney failure after discovering he loved downing a gallon of iced tea every day. Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock ruled out several causes for a 56-year-old man's kidney problems before blaming the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily. Black tea has high levels of oxalate, a chemical known to produce kidney stones and even lead to kidney failure if consumed in excessive doses. Scroll down for video . Toxic tea: Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock blamed a 56-year-old man's kidney problems on the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily . 'It was the only reasonable explanation,' said Dr Umbar Ghaffar of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who wrote about the patient in an article for the New England Journal of Medicine. The man was admitted to the hospital in May complaining of nausea, weakness, fatigue and body aches. The chemical oxalate was found to have clogged the man's kidneys, to the point that they had become inflamed. With a habit of drinking about 16 8-ounce cups of iced tea every day, the unidentified man was consuming anywhere from 3 to 10 times the amount an average American takes in. The 16-daily-cups habit was striking on its own, since federal studies have found that the average US adult drinks about 10 to 11 cups of liquid every day, including water, coffee and other beverages. Ghaffar said she didn't know whether the man was drinking sweet tea, a concoction made from black tea and a hefty serving of sugar that is popular in the South, though he was diabetic. The New England Journal of Medicine has cited black tea in health issues before, publishing a 2013 case that found a 47-year-old woman had developed a bone disease from drinking a pitcher of tea made from 100 to 150 bags of tea every day. The Arkansas man's case, however, does not suggest health risks for most people, according to Dr Randy Luciano, a Yale School of Medicine kidney specialist. 'I wouldn't tell people to stop drinking tea,' said Luciano, who has treated patients with oxalate-related kidney damage. That man drank 'a lot of tea.'\n",

            "Australia coach Darren Lehmann has defended his players following criticism of their behaviour during Sunday’s World Cup final win over New Zealand. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin came under fire for his send-off of Kiwi opener Martin Guptill, and a photograph of Haddin and all-rounder James Faulkner mocking Grant Elliott after his dismissal cast a shadow over the Australian’s fifth World Cup triumph. Brad Haddin clapped in Martin Guptill's face after the New Zealand batsman was bowled during the final . But Lehmann insisted Haddin was following team orders. And he was able to cite the ICC’s failure to censure his team as evidence that they hadn’t gone over the top. ‘He’s copped a bit, hasn’t he?’ Lehmann said. ‘No one got reported out of the game, so we must have played it fair. It was a little bit disappointing, but people are entitled to their opinions and you’re going to have good and bad times. You accept that and you move on. ‘We’re happy with the way we played, obviously. We knew we wanted to be really aggressive against them, and look, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.’ Grant Elliott (left) was also given a less-than-sporting send-off by Haddin and James Faulkner (second right) Boorish behaviour on Sunday cast a shadow over the Australian’s fifth World Cup triumph . But Sportsmail’s David Lloyd, who is part of the ICC’s umpire selection panel, has added his voice to the chorus of criticism aimed at the Australians. ‘I was very disappointed at some of the behaviour in cricket’s showpiece event, particularly from the Australians,’ he said. ‘Watching it on my TV, and as a president of a local league, I know what will happen: this will be repeated in leagues across the land, because the players will think it’s macho. It’s not.’ Meanwhile, ICC president Mustafa Kamal has resigned after falling out with his colleagues. Kamal, a Bangladeshi, had labelled the ICC the ‘Indian Cricket Council’ after his side’s quarter-final loss to India was marred by questionable umpiring, and was barred from presenting the trophy at the MCG on Sunday.\n",

            "It had seemed fake tan was here to stay after becoming a beauty staple for many women who wanted to emulate their favourite celebrities’ bronzed looks. But their determination to achieve the perfect glow appears to be fading away in favour of adopting a lighter look. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter (24.1 per cent) from the year before, bringing the value of sales down by 19.3 per cent to £14.5million. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter from last year. The product used to be a favourite of many celebrities including Victoria Beckham (left) and Sam Faiers (right) Georgia Percy, of retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel, which gathered the data, said it suggests women are ‘tending towards a more natural look’. She added that artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the sun care market. And Sandra Vaughan, a beauty consultant for artificial tan brand Fake Bake, said the pale look is now more fashionable. Fake tanning had become part of many women’s regular beauty regime thanks to its popularity among celebrities such as former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, the stars on Strictly Come Dancing and the cast – both male and female – of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. Sam Faiers, who was a brand ambassador for Fake Bake, has described her horror at looking unnaturally orange on occasion. Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, pictured (above) at the 87th annual Academy Awards, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow . She said: ‘Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done?!’ Other TOWIE performers have admitted similar errors, including Lauren Goodger, who was a particularly vivid colour when attending a Woman’s Own event last year. Even the programme itself has ridiculed the dangers of fake tan. Charlie Sims became a laughing stock after emerging from a spay tan session designed to improve his appearance and self-esteem only to look like an orange extra from the famous Tango TV commercials. His sister, Chloe Sims, famously stripped off to be the face and body of Montana Tan’s Starship Range. Georgia Percy, from Kantar Worldpanel, said sales of artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the suncare market in 2014. ‘As with total suncare, the key contributor to decline was fewer shoppers, suggesting women are tending towards a more natural look,’ she said. Lou Ellerton, of consultants the Value Engineers, told The Grocer magazine: ‘Reality TV shows were effectively ongoing ads for fake tan but they passed their peak. 'It’s like fake tan has been off the air for a while.’ Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow. The weather has also played a part, she said. ‘If skin is not on show, why dress it up?’\n",

            "Mark Wood spent a day this week donning his newly arrived England suit. ‘I wore it around the house a bit too much really but I was absolutely buzzing just to have it on. ‘Trying it on is when the mixture of nerves and excitement started,’ says Wood, one of the uncapped members of Alastair Cook’s squad who fly to the Caribbean on Thursday for a three-Test series against West Indies. The 25-year-old would be forgiven for checking the fit, because standing at 5ft 11in and weighing just over 12st, he is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler. Mark Wood has been called up by England for the Test series against West Indies . When he’s not steaming in to bowl at 90mph Mark Wood can find himself fielding for long stretches of time. Thankfully the Durham paceman has the perfect remedy to keep things interesting during a lengthy stint on the boundary rope. ‘There are times when it gets boring in the field, so I bring out the imaginary horse and try to joust my team-mates,’ Wood said recently. ‘I don’t know how the England boys will take it, but I’ll have a go. I like to have a trot and feed him apples — he loves Granny Smiths. ‘Sometimes it’s just the pick-me-up the lads need. The horse will probably come with me to the Caribbean if he gets through immigration. If they don’t like it then I can just tie him up and leave him somewhere.’ But England are looking for something different in the wake of their woeful World Cup and Wood, whose ability to hurry batsmen from a short run-up is reminiscent of Craig White and Simon Jones from previous eras, fits the bill. Several players on the county circuit last season would testify that he was the slipperiest bowler they faced. ‘I can hit 90mph but it’s not something I tend to concentrate on,’ said Wood. ‘The quickest ball I have been clocked at on the telly was 91 but I am sure I can bowl quicker than that. ‘You know yourself, without the speed guns, when it’s coming out lovely and the rhythm’s there. ‘When I bowl I am not just trying to blast people out, I would like to think that being the slight lad that I am with a short run-up, it is more the surprise element that gets batters in trouble. I tend to rush them a little bit but would like to think I have more skills than just raw pace.’ Primary among those skills is a mastery of reverse swing. It was no coincidence that his first three County Championship appearances for Durham all came at Trent Bridge, where the abrasive nature of the square roughs the ball up perfectly for exponents of the art. Durham paceman is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler . But he has also displayed a marked improvement in his use of the new ball, swinging it to good effect whenever he got it during the 2014 season. Previously, he faced a battle to prise it from the hands of his Durham team-mates Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth. So a marker of his progress was provided at the turn of this year when he was opening the bowling for England Lions on the tour of South Africa. That breakthrough moment on the field has been replicated off it, with Wood’s devotion to the ECB’s fitness regime enabling him to play a string of matches following a career punctuated by injuries, including stress fractures of the back, a cyst on his left ankle, knee trouble and side strains. ‘My body type has changed a lot since I was the lad who broke through into the first team,’ he said. ‘I have done two winters now where they have basically pumped us up in the gym to get us stronger and fitter. ‘I did a four-week camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa, before Christmas when I was smashing myself along with the other fast bowlers. That got me the Lions call-up and off that, maintaining that strength, got me the Test call-up.’ Wood has sought advice from former Durham and England fast bowler Steve Harmison . His first-class haul of 74 wickets at 26 runs apiece is creditable even if his number of appearances, 23, is a bit thin. But as he showed in taking four Australia A wickets in as many overs in a Durham win at Chester-le-Street three years ago, he has the knack of getting good players out. It may help him sneak ahead of Liam Plunkett or Chris Jordan in the pace pecking order. ‘I am not going to the West Indies to make the numbers up. I want to play a Test match, whether it be the first, middle or last one,’ he said. ‘It’s a good opportunity. As an England fan it has been frustrating to watch during the winter but everyone will agree that to put things right we have to start in the Caribbean.’ It was for the carnage created at Sabina Park, Jamaica, that Steve Harmison, another cricketing son of Ashington, was renamed Grievous Bodily Harmison 11 years ago. ‘There’s no pressure on us, is there?’ said Wood. ‘The last lad from Ashington took seven for 12. But if I get half of that I will be doing all right. Steve’s a family friend so he’s offered me advice on what the pitches will be like and how I should go about things. The main thing he told me is that the stumps don’t move — we had a bit of a joke about that because of the ball he bowled in Brisbane (the first delivery of the 2006-07 Ashes, which went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip) — his point being that if you make sure you get the first one on target you’ll be fine after that.’ They are big shoes to fill but Wood appears comfortable in his own.\n",

            "Jose Mourinho has thickened up his Chelsea midfield for Sunday's west London derby at QPR. The Chelsea manager has been trialling a formation with Ramires and Nemanja Matic in front of the back four as the league leaders head to Loftus Road. Mourinho has stuck with the team that it is likely to mean a more advanced role for Cesc Fabregas in the 'No10' position behind Didier Drogba up front, with fellow striker Loic Remy out injured. Brazilian midfielder Oscar has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games . Eden Hazard, who Mourinho believes is the only realistic candidate to be named PFA player of the year, starts on the left. Willian will start on the right and his Brazilian team-mate Oscar may drop out of the starting line up for the clash at QPR.

            "A Chinese policewoman fought off a machete-wielding thug with her bare hands, despite sustaining several wounds in the process. The unarmed 22-year-old, Cao Yu, held off the man in a terrifying five-minute struggle in a public square in Guizhou province in southwestern China earlier this month.

            "It is a well-known fact that the technology industry is mostly dominated by men, but now, thanks to a new blog by a young female computing student, women in tech have finally been given a platform through which their amazing achievements are being recognized. Stanford computer science student Lea Coligado, 21, created Women of Silicon Valley, a blog based on the people-profiling website Humans of New York,in order to showcase the talents and stories of tech's best and brightest women working within the industry. 'Over the past couple years, I've come into contact with some awesome women in tech through Stanford or work, and I kept thinking to myself, why have I never heard of them before?' Lea told BuzzFeed. Girls on top: Stanford computer science student Lea Coligado features talented women in the tech industry, such as Postmates exec Sara Mauskopf, on her blog Women of Silicon Valley . Relatable: Many of the subjects featured on the blog talk on subjects that many women in the industry will have had to deal with . Looking up: The blog has attracted attention from the best in the business, including women-in-tech advocate Tracy Chou, a software engineer at Pinterest . The blog, like the one that inspired it, features photos and stories of subjects in the industry, often accompanying them with inspirational quotes. In the description for the blog, Lea says that the goal of the project is 'to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success, these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms.' In her 'Letter from the Editor', Lea also describes how an internship she completed at Facebook was viewed as a 'give away' by one of her classmates – who suggested that anyone would be able to secure one of the highly sought-after positions if a woman had been offered one, despite applauding a male friend for being given the very same job. She recounts other moments of horrific sexism she has experienced while working in various offices - from shameless come-ons from married colleagues to blanket, patronizing statements of 'women don't code' told directly to her by colleagues. The brains behind it all: Lea Coligado, 21, created the blog after experiencing the bias against women in the industry first-hand . Underrepresented: The Women in Silicon Valley blog aims 'to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success, these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms' Quotables: The women featured on the blog open up about their own experiences of subtle - and less subtle - sexism in the office . It was after such experiences that, Lea says, she realized the importance of having idols in the industry. Speaking in more detail to Buzzfeed, she added: 'As a woman who's worked in almost entirely male environments, I know being able to look up to someone is crucial for getting through rough patches, for feeling a sense of belonging to your work.' The idea has already attracted some big names, including some of the most vocal advocates for women in tech like Tracy Chou, who joined social media giant Pinterest, where she still works as a software engineer, back when it was still a start-up. Tracy herself has also made strides in bringing awareness to the gender disparity in tech. Inspired: The blog's goal is to is to inspire women to continue on in computer sciences, because it is more possible to succeed than some may think . All together: The blog encourages women to be proud of their own achievements and encourage others in similar circumstances . In a blog post last year on Medium the engineer wrote: 'The actual numbers I’ve seen and experienced in industry are far lower than anybody is willing to admit. This means nobody is having honest conversations about the issue.' With that in mind, Tracy created a GitHub spreadsheet in which tech companies could reveal their demographics to world, and over 200 companies have self-reported on their diversity since. But the numbers don't look good when it comes to some of the world’s most well-known tech companies. Dropbox records that only 26 of its 275 software engineering employees are female, while Etsy records 19 of 149 and GitHub shows only 10 out of 160. In her quest to raise awareness, and with names like Tracy's in her corner, Lea is hoping to one day feature the likes of Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, and Laura Weidman Powers, the CEO and co-founder of  non-profit tech-focused organisation CODE2040. 'I want women who are sitting on the fence about Computer Science to get as inspired as I was by these role models,' Lea told Buzzfeed. 'And hopefully, to see that at its heart tech is exciting, immensely powerful and so, so worth it.'\n",

            "This is the dramatic moment a fireman risked his own life to grab the arm of a woman who was attempting to throw herself off the ledge of a 10-storey Chinese tower block. The video - filmed by a passer-by in Shanghai - shows the young woman dangling off the ledge having apparently threatened to jump, reports People's Daily Online. Police had failed to convince the woman - who was depressed after being dumped by her boyfriend - to climb back into a nearby apartment while firefighters on the street below prepared a ladder to try to reach her. Video footage captured the moment fireman Xu Weiguo grabbed the suicidal woman's arm just in time . But before the ladder could be used the woman became more agitated and suddenly lowered herself on to the edge of the concrete ledge. Fireman Xu Weiguo, who was also inside the apartment, immediately climbed out on to the ledge and video shows him grabbing her arm just as she appears to be pushing herself away. He holds on to her right arm and is seen calling for someone to assist him before a colleague also clambers out on to the ledge to help to haul the woman to safety. She was then pushed kicking and screaming back in through the window by the firemen before being restrained by police officers and taken to hospital. He had clambered out on to the ledge when police failed to talk her down . Having held on to her arm, a colleague then joined him to help pull her back on to the ledge . The woman reportedly said she'd felt depressed after being dumped by her boyfriend . She was eventually bundled back through the window kicking and screaming by the firemen . Xu has been widely praised for his actions but insisted he was only doing his job. He told ThePaper.cn 'At the time I hadn't even put on my safety rope or even my helmet when I heard someone outside shout, \"She's going to jump\". 'I didn't have time to think - I just ran through the apartment and seeing her hanging on the ledge I jumped through the window and grabbed her arm. 'As the ledge is narrow and difficult for me to get good leverage I had to flatten myself out and wait for my colleagues to help. Luckily we were able to save the woman. 'There was no time to think, the entire rescue took 2-3 minutes. Any hesitation by me and she may have fallen off the ledge so I didn't have any of my safety apparatus in place when I grabbed her. 'It was quite dangerous. Under normal operational procedures I would have to wear my helmet as well as my safety ropes.'\n",

            "A private funeral service attended by ex-players Shane Warne and Ian Chappell was held on Wednesday for former Australia cricket captain and commentator Richie Benaud. Benaud died last Friday at the age of 84 of complications from skin cancer. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had extended the offer of a state funeral to Benaut's wife, Daphne, which she declined. Mr Abbott said the offer was a mark of respect for a man who meant so much to millions of people in Australia and around the world. Richie Benaud's small private funeral was attended by close family and friends in Sydney on Wednesday . Benaud's memorial booklet, titled 'Remembering Richie', included a few words thanking the guests . Daphne Benaud (centre), with family and friends, listens to speeches about her late husband Richie .

February 1964: Final Test against South Africa at Sydney Cricket Ground . September 2005: Final commentary in England after 42 years . But after he received a phone call from Mrs Benaud, he remarked 'my understanding is that Richie's own wishes was for something very, very quiet and very, very private'. Instead, Benaut's family opted for a smaller service at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park attended only by family and close friends. Benaud's former teammate, Brian Booth, led the service. In the memorial booklet, his family described Benaud as 'a special person who means so much to each of us in many different ways.' Benaud, considered one of the most influential cricket identities of the past century, played 63 tests for Australia but was more well-known for his career in the commentating booth. Following the funeral service, a memorial was held at the Australian Golf Club attended by Richie's former cricket commentating colleagues, Channel Nine network executives and Test cricketers past and present. Benaud was loved by many cricket fans around the world for his distinctive voice and commentary style . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his time as Australia captain .

            "A nursing assistant stuffed a wet wipe into 96-year-old Phyllis Hadlow's (pictured) mouth to silence the dementia patient's screams . A hospital nursing assistant stuffed a wet wipe into a 96-year-old woman's mouth to stop her screaming. Deborah Roberts, 53, forced the tissue into Phyllis Hadlow's mouth in an attempt to silence her in front of other nursing staff at Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She also poured water over the dementia patient, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' A court heard how Roberts, 53, mistreated Mrs Hadlow when the elderly widow was being treated at the hospital. Roberts was found guilty of one count of ill-treatment or wilful neglect of a person without capacity following a two-day trial - but avoided a prison sentence. Mrs Hadlow, who has since died, needed extensive medical care and would occasionally lash out and shout, Canterbury Magistrates' Court was told. Staff nurse Janet Nelson said she heard screaming coming from her bed and went to investigate, only to see Roberts shove the wet wipe into the elderly woman's mouth. Roberts told her she did it to stop the patient screaming and Mrs Nelson  told her: 'I don't want to see this again.' In a separate incident, Mrs Hadlow threw water at Roberts so she retaliated by filling a plastic cup with water and pouring some on her head. Healthcare assistant Lisa Ross said Roberts told her: 'I have had enough of this. My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' Roger Davies, defending, said Roberts had wrecked a lifelong career and was now unemployable as a nursing assistant. Roberts, who worked at Kent & Canterbury Hospital, also poured water over the elderly widow, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' He said: 'She didn't think about the consequences of her actions. She will be reminded every week of what she has done and the price she has paid.' Roberts, from Deal, Kent was suspended after the incident in October 2013 and then sacked. Julie Pearce, chief nurse and director of quality for East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are very sorry for the care Mrs Hadlow received whilst in our hospital and for the distress this would have caused to herself and her family. 'As soon as we were made aware of these allegations in October 2013 we suspended Mrs Roberts, referred the incident to the police and subsequently dismissed her following a disciplinary hearing.' Mrs Hadlow's son, Dennis, 71, who was too upset to face sitting through the trial, said: 'We know people with advanced dementia can be difficult to handle but the staff are supposed to be trained. 'I am glad the witnesses who saw what happened had the courage to speak out. 'We were told the sentence was one step below being sent to prison, but it will also have ended her career.' Roberts was given a one-year community order, which includes 120 hours of unpaid work, and was ordered to pay £750 costs.\n",

            "The Manchester derby will be more like El Clasico, with 14 native Spanish-speaking players due to be involved. Eight of United’s first-team squad and six from City are from Spain or Spanish-speaking countries. They are David de Gea, Victor Valdes, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera (all Spain), Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria (both Argentina), Antonio Valencia (Ecuador) and Falcao (Colombia) at United, and Willy Caballero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Sergio Aguero (all Argentina), Jesus Navas and David Silva (both Spain) at City. Sergio Aguero will be one of 14 native Spanish-speaking players to feature in the Manchester derby on Sunday . United captain Wayne Rooney (centre) is likely to be just one of nine English-speakers to feature on Sunday . Nine English-speakers are expected to be in the two sides’ respective 18-man squads including England internationals Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Ashley Young, Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart, James Milner as well as Frank Lampard. Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United . Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke . For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. Unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Louis van Gaal's United line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Unless Tyler Blackett (centre) makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs .\n",

            "Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian has been detained in Iran for eight months and faces trial for 'security charges' unspecified by the government . A Washington Post journalist who has been detained in Iran for eight months has been accused of 'espionage' and 'acting against national security', according to an Iranian news agency. Iranian officials announced in January that Jason Rezaian, who is the Post's Tehran bureau chief, would stand trial before the country's Revolutionary Court to face 'security charges', but did not elaborate what those charges were. The Fars news agency did not reveal the source for their information, but the agency is considered to be close to the ultra conservative Iran hard-liners. The report alleges that Rezaian, 39, obtained economic and industrial information from the country and then sold it to unnamed Americans. Rezaian was also linked to Omid Memarian, a US-based Iranian opposition journalist, in the report. Fars claimed that 'selling Iran's economic and industrial information at a time of sanctions is exactly like selling food at a time of war'. Iran is subject to sanctions from the U.S, Europe and the United Nations due to its nuclear program. In the Washington Post, executive editor Martin Baron called the allegations a 'farce and a sham'. 'Seven months have passed without Iranian legal authorities publicly outlining the allegations against Jason,' he said. 'Now we have someone outside the judiciary system making outlandish allegations that come with no evidence. This isn't justice.' Leila Ahsan, Rezaian's lawyer, would not comment on the specific charges that have been brought against her client but said she has studied the text of the indictment and will brief his family in the upcoming days. Ashan said she visited the journalist in prison last month and that he appeared to be 'in good health and spirits'. 'I can see him anytime,' she said. 'Jason asked me to provide a strong defense. I'm in constant touch with his wife and family. I've requested that the court hold the trial as soon as possible.' An Iranian news agency considered to be close to Iran hard-liners claims that Rezaian (pictured with his wife Yaganeh Salehi) has been accused of 'espionage' and 'acting against national security' Rezaian and his wife, Iranian-born Yeganeh Salehi, were taken from their Tehran home on July 22 and detained with two photojournalists. All were released except for American-born Rezaian, who  has dual citizenship that is not recognized by Iran. Rezaian was not allowed to hire a lawyer until seven months after he was first arrested. His family was also not permitted from hiring Masoud Shafiei, who was their first choice for Rezaian's attorney because of his experience with representing imprisoned foreigners and dual citizens. Shafiei was forbidden from taking the case by the judiciary for unspecified reasons, according to the New York Times. Last month President Barack Obama called on the Iranian government to immediately release Rezaian as well as two other detained Americans, Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati.\n",

            "Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists he is better than many of the Premier League's big-name managers but has no immediate plans to leave Selhurst Park for a table-topping side. Palace have won six out of 10 league games since Pardew succeeded Neil Warnock at the start of the year to all but guarantee their place in the Premier League next season. The Eagles were in the bottom three when Pardew took over and their climb up the table has succeeded in easing relegation fears and subsequently boosting the profile of a manager who has yet to take charge of a club constantly vying for honours. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew believes he has the ability to manage one of England's top sides . Pardew, pictured with Arsene Wenger, feels he could do a better job than some of his rival managers . Pardew harbours no thoughts of leaving Palace in the near future, but maintains he would acquit himself better than some of the managers currently employed by the Premier League's trophy-chasing sides. 'I look at the top teams and feel I could do that job better than I'm seeing it being done,' Pardew told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'But I'm quite happy where I am and if I work in this part of the league for the rest of my career I will be extremely happy. 'I'm really happy here - I don't really want another job,' he added. 'In a way the (Palace) board have been lucky because even if I have great success here I won't be looking to jump away.' The Crystal Palace manager, pictured with Yannick Bolasie, has said he is not looking to jump ship . Manchester City will provide a stern test of Pardew's managerial ability when they visit Selhurst Park on Monday and Pardew hopes his side's teamwork can overcome the considerable technical ability of Manuel Pellegrini's star-studded line-up. 'Mr Pellegrini's options on the bench will be significantly stronger than my own to try and get a result in the game with 15 minutes to go. 'But it doesn't always work out like that, (as) Burnley proved to Man City it is about sometimes the team being stronger than the individual and on Monday night we hope that's the case for Crystal Palace.'\n",

            "A Craig Cathcart goal was enough to put Watford top of the Championship with just two games of the season remaining following a 1-0 win over Birmingham. The Hornets went into the game knowing a win would take them back into the automatic promotion places following Middlesbrough's victory at Norwich on Friday. They looked as though they would have to settle for second after Matt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead against Sheffield Wednesday and on course for top spot, but Chris Maguire's stoppage-time penalty at the Goldsands Stadium denied the Cherries and left Watford on top of the pile. Craig Cathcart fired Watford into the lead with a stunning strike in the 56th minute . Birmingham goalkeeper Darren Randolph. is powerless to stop Cathcart's sublime effort . The decisive goal at Vicarage Road came in the 56th minute when substitute Ikechi Anya crossed from the left and Cathcart sent a fine volleyed finish into the top corner past goalkeeper Darren Randolph. Despite looking good in possession going forward, it took the Hornets almost 20 minutes to begin to open up the Birmingham defence. They were unfortunate not to take the lead, though, when a fine pass from Adlene Guedioura created the opportunity for Troy Deeney who was denied by a good save with his legs by Randolph. The ball then broke for Matej Vydra, whose follow-up was deflected up and onto the crossbar. Vydra and Guedioura threatened before the home side went close again when the ball was played into Almen Abdi and he spun superbly away from his man to shift the ball onto his left foot before curling a shot narrowly wide of the far post. Cathcart races away to celebrate his decisive goal for the Hornets . Watford continued to press for the breakthrough in the remainder of the first half but they were unable to seriously threaten again before the interval. But it was a double change from manager Slavisa Jokanovic in the 54th minute that was to prove the catalyst for his side taking the lead as he brought on Anya and Odion Ighalo for Miguel Layun and Vydra. Within two minutes, Anya had been released down the left by Deeney and the Scotland international's first-time cross into the near post was met by a superb effort over his right shoulder by Cathcart. Scotland forward Ikechi Anya made a huge contribution when he was introduced in the 54th minute . Having gone in front, Watford missed a great chance to double their lead a couple of minutes later when Almen Abdi's floated free-kick picked out the unmarked Gabriele Angella, but he headed over the top. Angella had another chance and on this occasion he did nothing wrong, meeting an Abdi corner with a downward header only to see it cleared off the goal-line. There was little else in the way of goalmouth action, with the drama instead coming on the south coast as Jokanovic's men were left with their destiny in their own hands.\n",

            "As Kate and William prepare for the arrival of the second child, the British public are keeping their fingers crossed that they will opt for a traditional name. A new poll has revealed that Diana is the favourite option for baby if it is a girl. According to the YouGov survey for the Sunday Times, 12 per cent of people questioned thought that the child should be named after William's mother - Diana the Princess of Wales. Kate and William leaving the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, with their newborn son, Prince George in 2013. Brits are hoping for a baby princess this time and favour the name  Diana . Alice and Charlotte were next in terms of preference, getting nine per cent of the vote each. Alice is the name of the Queen's aunt, who passed away in 2004 aged 102, while Charlotte is favoured as a nod to William's father Charles. According to the newspaper, if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James, with the second favourite name being Alexander. Many people are hoping for a girl though - of the 2,200 people polled, a quarter said they wanted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to have a female baby, with only three percent hoping for a younger brother for George. Diana is the favourite name for the second royal baby, name after Williams mother - the late Princess Of Wales . The choices were echoed on social media today, with many Twitter users claiming they would be delighted if Kate and William decided to name the baby after his mother. One user called Danielle O'Donoghue wrote: 'If Kate Middleton has a baby girl and doesn't name her Diana I'll be so upset.

            "(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. \"Marijuana...?\" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, \"I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing.\" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, \"You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering.\" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to \"turn around.\" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first \"Weed\" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in \"Weed 3,\" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When \"Weed 2: Cannabis Madness\" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. \"This time will be different,\" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .\n",

The crackling, deep-sea type sound is reminiscent of what Madison might have heard in the womb just a month earlier. It seems that parents really will try anything to get their newborn to stop crying and go to bed - even the Dark Side.

The clip, called The Force Awakens... then falls back asleep, has been viewed more than 4,000 times . The Dark Lords of the Sith's heavy-breathing sound was devised by American sound engineer Ben Burtt in the Seventies.

Lucasfilm reportedly trademarked 234 seconds of it with the US Patent and Trademark Office in 2014. The grisly sound of Vader's breathing is so iconic that it even has a trademark - or, rather, a 'soundmark' Its creator Ben Burtt says it makes Vader sound like a 'life support system', 'mechanical', and 'part robot' The firm's lawyers describe the sound as 'rhythmic mechanical human breathing created by breathing through a scuba tank regulator.' An interview with the sound's designer, Burtt, from the Lucasfilm archives, shows him describing the process. He says that what started out as a very loud and noise-producing project which made Vader sound like a 'moving operating room' and 'queezing windmill', was eventually toned down to the 'life support system', 'mechanical', 'part robot' sound we know today.\n",

            "Grandparents have pleaded for the safe return to Australia of two young children whose mother took them from Melbourne to the Islamic State capital in Syria. Former Melbourne woman Dullel Kassab fled to Raqqa in Syria with her children last year, and she regularly boasts on Twitter that her four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son sleep with toy guns next to their beds and her daughter likes watching IS videos of 'Muslims killing bad ppl.' The children's paternal grandparents say they are worried Kassab, 28, is 'brainwashing' the children, after their father was killed near the Syria-Turkey border last year, The Herald Sun reported. Former Melbourne woman Dullel Kassab fled to Raqqa in Syria from Melbourne with her children last year . Kassab posts pictures to Twitter of airstrikes hitting blocks away from their Raqqa apartment . 'We miss the children a lot. Their safety and religion has been compromised and we are deeply worried but unable to do anything about it,' a family spokesman told the Herald Sun. 'We pray they come back but it does not look good.' Kassab's Twitter paints a picture of their life in the city the terrorist group IS have made their headquarters, where the children cannot go to school and airstrikes hit blocks away from their apartment. The 28-year-old has a new husband, as the Islamic State does not permit unmarried foreign women to stay in Raqqa. In social media posts she boasts about her children's distaste for Kuffar (non-believers).

[sic]' she wrote in December. '#Awkward Just asked my 4yo wat she wants 2 watch.. \"Muslims killing bad ppl\" (i.e. #IS vids obv not beheading ones) LOL [sic],' she wrote in October. Kassab has also complained the 12 to 17-year-olds are now regarded as children when 'in the past they were warriors'. And during the Sydney Lindt café siege in December last year she sent a series of tweets joking that it was exciting. 'This is the most excitement Sydney has seen since the 2000 Olympics!' she posted.

            "Hillary Clinton’s security detail arrived at a suburban Des Moines, Iowa fruit processing company on Tuesday with an added vehicle – a second Scooby. After her signature oversize black Chevy conversion van dropped her off at Capitol Fruit Company in Norwalk, Iowa, a visually identical GMC van drove up to the building with a nearly identical Secret Service escort vehicle. Both armored vehicles have raised roofs, deep-tinted windows and New York license plates. But while the original van – the one nicknamed 'Scooby' after the Scooby-Doo cartoon show – sports a mustard-yellow New York tag, the second has blue and white plates of a different design. Scroll down for video . WHY BUY ONE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE TWO AT TWICE THE PRICE? The first picture of both of Hillary Clinton's Scooby mobiles. One is a GMC and the other is a Chevrolet, but they are mechanically identical . CONVOY: Scooby-one and Scooby-two took up positions in Hillary's motorcade on a freeway near Des Moines . BACK SEAT DRIVER? Hillary Clinton climbs into the so-called Scooby van after a campaign stop at Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa . Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It’s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate’s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade. UNDER GUARD: Two Secret Service agents with Scooby One in Iowa today . MOTORCADE: The Clinton convoy includes both Scooby vans and four black Suburbans, believed to all be Secret Service vehicles. It also included a white minivan on Wednesday . Scooby-Two’s driver brought up the rear, at enough of a distance to allow another car to pull in front of him. When that car stopped at a red light, the GMC van’s blue and red flashing lights came on. The stray car’s driver pulled to one side and Scooby-Two zoomed into the intersection, against the light . DECOYS: The Secret Service frequently deploys duplicates of aircraft and cars it uses to transport VIPs – including Marine One, the president's customized helicopter, which usually travels with two decoys .\n",

            "Surgeons have removed kidneys that each weighed as much as a newborn baby from an Indian man with a genetic disorder. The giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs (2.7kg) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been. It was was extracted from a 45-year-old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This condition causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in the kidneys, so they expand in size. Surgeons have removed the kidneys, which weighed as much as a newborn baby, from a 45-year-old man with a genetic disease. Scan shows the kidneys, which had grown to 20 times their normal size . Incredibly, a week after his initial operation at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs (2.5kg) was removed. Both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs (2.1kg), which was removed in Dhule, India, in 2011, according to Guinness World Records. Normally, healthy kidneys weigh between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD, which is potentially lethal, last year. He arrived at the hospital suffering from high fever, blood in his urine and severe abdominal pain before he was admitted. 'I used to remain tired throughout the day due to excessive blood loss,' the patient, whose name has not been released by the hospital, said. It took a team of surgeons three hours to remove the giant organ, before he was then put on dialysis. He will soon receive a kidney transplant. Dr Bhargav, one of the surgeons who carried out the procedure, said: 'The kidney was 20 times the normal size and was stuck around the intestines. Normal healthy kidneys weight between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. One of the kidneys the doctors removed weighed 6lbs (2.7kg) (is is pictured on the scales) 'The patient is recovering and awaiting a kidney transplant.' ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Cysts develop in the kidneys, and often the livers and the pancreas. Over time, they grow and multiple, replacing normal healthy tissue and causing the kidneys to stop working. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms and the cysts won't be noticed until adulthood. They will vary by individual but may include back or abdominal pain, recurrent urinary infections or blood in the urine, kidney stones and kidney failure. Two thirds of adults with ADPKD will develop high blood pressure, and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children are born with the condition, ADPKD does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until 30-60 years of age. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including abdominal pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urine infections and kidney stones. Eventually, kidney function gets worse and worse, until so much is lost that kidney failure develops. ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Sources: NHS Choices and Polycystic Kidney Charity .\n",

            "Jack Nicklaus believes it is time for the 'young guys to take over' after Jordan Spieth's record-breaking Masters victory on Sunday. Nicklaus was hugely impressed by Spieth's four-shot win over Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson, which saw him set 36 and 54-hole scoring records, equal the 72-hole record set by Tiger Woods in 1997 and also become the first player ever to reach 19 under par at Augusta. The 21-year-old, who was second last year, moved from fourth in the world rankings to second behind Rory McIlroy as a result and that means the world's top two players have a combined age of 46. In comparison, Mickelson is 44 and Tiger Woods 39. Jordan Spieth (left) sent a number of Augusta records tumbling on his way to winning The Masters . The 21-year-old Spieth equalled Tiger Woods' 72-hole record and became the first man to get to 19-under par . Jack Nicklaus (right) lauded Spieth, and heralded a new golfing era led by him and Rory McIlroy . McIlroy and Spieth have a combined age of 46, where as Phil Mickelson (left) is 44 and Tiger Woods 39 . 'That was an incredible performance,' six-time Masters champion Nicklaus said in a statement. 'It was so apparent that he learned down the stretch last year, but you have to remember he was only 20 at the time. 'Now he's a grizzled veteran at 21 years old - just 21. Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about the young man. He's polite. He's humble. He handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion. I think Jordan Spieth is a great person - just as I think Rory McIlroy is - to carry the mantle for the game of golf. 'I am someone who likes the new generations. I always have. I think it energises the game of golf. We had Arnold's (Palmer) generation, then it came to my generation, then Tom Watson came along and right on down the line to Tiger and Rory. 'And now we have Jordan Spieth. There are some older players who have been terrific for a long time, but actually this might be time for the young guys to take over.' Spieth's mentor and fellow Texan Ben Crenshaw also paid tribute to the new champion after watching the final round from his home in Austin. 'I don't know what it is, but he just has this maturity,' Crenshaw, who missed the cut in his 44th and final consecutive Masters appearance last week, told the PGA Tour website. 'He's got an awareness of where's he going. He's got a plan. Nicklaus believes that the duo of Spieth (left) and McIlroy 'energise' the game of golf . McIlroy came fourth in The Masters, falling short in an attempt to seal a career grand slam before he turns 26 . Ben Crenshaw, Spieth's mentor, praised the maturity he displayed to become the new Masters champion . Greg Norman took to Twitter to praise Spieth and also revealed his excitement for the future of golf . 'When I look at him, I look into a future. He's a player with so much imagination. I cannot wait to watch him play the Open at St. Andrews. It's a place where you have to have so much imagination. It's going to be fun.' Former world number one Greg Norman wrote on Twitter: 'Golf is in great hands @McIlroyRory and @TheMasters champ @JordanSpieth plus a cast of other phenomenal players. Great to see.'\n",

Michael Bialek also described as a 'complex character as many young people are today' but added she was a loving mother, daughter and wife and he simply wanted her home.

            "Former Italy forward Antonio Di Natale has described Alexis Sanchez as the best strike partner he's ever had and insisted the Arsenal forward is better than Neymar. Di Natale, who won 42 caps for Italy between 2002 and 2012, spent five years playing alongside Sanchez at Udinese, who he still captains at the age of 37. Azzurri legends Francesco Totti and Alessandro Del Piero are just two of the names Di Natale has played alongside but he told Arsenal's official website that Sanchez tops the lot. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez has been hailed as the best strike partner Antonio Di Natale ever had . Sanchez has been in storming form with 20 goals in all competitions during his debut season with the Gunners . The Chilean played alongside Di Natale (left) for five years at Serie A side Udinese . He said: 'I know what you are going to ask. And the answer is: Yes he's the best partner I had in my life. 'Like you say, I've played with a lot of champions, but he is the best; and he' s proven it by performing for enormous clubs such as Barcelona and Arsenal. 'It' s quite easy to be a star in a little or medium team, where there is no pressure and where competition is far to be ferocious. 'But to confirm your individual qualities within the biggest teams is something only few can achieve.' Asked to compare Sanchez and Neymar, Di Natale added: 'If I had to choose one, I'd choose Alexis: because he's a little more concrete.' Di Natale claims his former team-mate is better than Neymar, who effectively replaced him at Barcelona . Former World Cup winners Francesco Totti (left) and Alessandro del Piero are among Di Natale's former strike partners with Italy . Di Natale has put his former team-mate's unbelievable work ethic as the secret behind his success. 'I was amazed by his technical skills: he did things with the ball that were more typical of a juggler than a footballer. But what really impressed me was the approach he had to the everyday work. 'In my career, I've seen a lot of talented players squandering their abilities with the wrong attitude, with a sort of indolence. Alexis was the contrary. 'I've never seen him distracted, he was always attentive and focused, he was always ready to work harder in order to improve, to add some new trick to his natural talent. 'This is probably his secret, and the thing that has allowed him to become one of the greatest players around today: he combines individual quality with a willingness for collective sacrifice.'\n",

            "Grant Shapps was last night at the centre of extraordinary claims that he was doctoring Wikipedia pages to promote himself at the expense of his political rivals. The Tory party chairman is accused of deleting embarrassing references to his past from his own page in the online encyclopedia while putting unflattering updates on the pages of others. A furious Mr Shapps denied the claims, published by the Guardian, describing them as an ‘extreme dirty tricks campaign’. David Cameron defended Mr Shapps, saying that the party chairman is doing 'a great job' while on the campaign trail today. Scroll down for video . Grant Shapps, pictured campaigning with Esther McVey yesterday, has been accused of changing Wikipedia pages to promote himself and damage rivals . Mr Shapps has denied the allegations claiming they were part of 'an extreme dirty tricks campaign' Wikipedia has suspended an anonymous user of the site, known only as ‘Contribsx’, after finding evidence it said suggested the account was run either by Mr Shapps or under his ‘clear direction’. It cited a series of amendments made by the user to pages of the site, around one third of which involved removing embarrassing references on Mr Shapps’s own page. Other changes included adding critical language to the pages of Tory Cabinet ministers including International Development Secretary Justine Greening and campaign chief Lynton Crosby. The timing and content of some of the edits appear to tally with instances when Mr Shapps clashed with the subject of the changes. The Tories described the story as ‘completely false and defamatory’. Last night Mr Shapps said: ‘It’s categorically untrue. It’s absolutely nothing to do with me. It’s just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.’ But it emerged in 2012 that changes to Mr Shapps’s Wikipedia page were made from computers in his constituency office. At the time, he said he had amended pages claiming he was ‘a Jehovah’s Witness, agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall’. A Wikipedia account using the alias 'Contribsx' edited a number of pages linked to Mr Shapps and other prominent politicians . Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits . When Mr Cameron was asked if he has 'full confidence' in Mr Shapps today, he replied: 'Grant does a great job. He has made a very clear statement about this and I have got nothing to add to that.' The Conservative chairman told the BBC: 'This is one of the most bonkers stories I think I have seen during this election campaign. Absolutely, totally without foundation. 'It seems to be based on the word of a single Wikipedia anonymous editor who, for all I know, is a Labour Party apparatchik.' An investigation by Wikipedia claimed the Contribsx account ‘is a ‘sockpuppet of Grant Shapps’ previous accounts on Wikipedia’. Sockpuppet refers to a fake online identity used ‘for an improper purpose’ and is banned on the site. Among the changes revealed include information about Miss Greening, who had disagreed with Mr Shapps over his support for a third runway at Heathrow. In September 2013 the user said she ‘failed to vote in a critical parliamentary division about military action in Syria’ as she failed to notice the division bell had sounded, despite being in the House of Commons. The user also made edits on Mr Crosby in March and August last year, at times when there were reports of splits between the two men. Mr Shapps took the blame after the 2014 Budget over a ‘patronising’ picture he tweeted about cuts in beer tax and bingo which would help ‘hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy’. Contribsx edited Mr Shapps’ Wikipedia page to suggest he had unfairly taken the blame for the picture, which was the fault of Mr Crosby and Chancellor George Osborne. In September 2013, Contribsx added these passages to Justine Greening's Wikipedia entry, highlighting her opposition to the expansion of Heathrow and an embarrassing incident in the House of Commons . The user added the highlighted text about the gay marriage bill to Dominic Grieve's page . Mr Shapps's Wikipedia page stated that he had edited the site 'removing negative information', as shown in the highlighted text top image, but Contribsx changed it to cast the minister in a better light . A recent Contribsx edit, on Easter Sunday this year, changed the page of Karl Turner, the shadow attorney general, adding a reference to the Labour MP having ‘admitted breaking House of Commons rules by sending out invitations to a £45-a-head Labour party fundraising event from parliamentary email’. Two weeks earlier Mr Turner had called on Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate Mr Shapps over his denials that he had continued to use the pseudonym Michael Green while he was an MP. Wikipedia is like a normal encyclopedia but its pages can be created and edited online by anyone. Volunteer administrators moderate the site and monitor changes. Changes to pages create an audit trail which can be linked back to users. Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth said: ‘This is another embarrassing episode in the saga of Grant Shapps. It’s about time we had some answers, from him and from David Cameron who appointed him to run the Tory campaign.’ Liberal Democrat campaign chairman Paddy Ashdown sent a light-hearted press release that read: ‘Grant is a wonderful guy - he is a credit to the Conservative Party, a fine sportsman and reads a book a day. We could all learn a lot from him. Quite simply, a colossus.’ The press release noted that it had been ‘edited by Wikipedia user Contribsx’. Mr Shapps's own Wikipedia page was edited by Contribsx in March 2014 to shift the blame for a controversial tweet on the Budget to George Osborne and Lynton Crosby; the passage in question is pictured before and after the edit . A passage added to Vince Cable's page by Contribsx drew attention to his alleged disloyalty to Nick Clegg . The highlighted passage appeared on Labour MP Karl Turner's Wikipedia page after it was edited by Contribsx earlier this month . In a statement released last night, Mr Shapps said: 'It is untrue from start to finish, and was quite likely dreamt up by the Labour press office. Sadly it is typical of the smears coming from those who would rather not debate policy and substance.' A spokesman from Wikimedia UK, the UK charity that supports Wikipedia, told The Guardian: 'We would welcome any MPs who choose to become editors, and are happy to provide training sessions to anyone who wants to learn. 'However, the Wikipedia project is founded on trust, and anyone who tries to deceive our volunteers and readers in order to further their own ends should think very carefully about the morality of what they're doing. Eventually, the public will find out.' The Tory chairman who gave himself a false identity . Tory chairman Grant Shapps is nicknamed the Duracell bunny for his seemingly unstoppable energy and his willingness to appear on any TV show to defend the government. But it is another name – Michael Green – for which he has become infamous in recent years. Green was an alter ego that Mr Shapps used to promote get rich quick products before he became an MP. The revelation that he had used the alias even prompted a man to change his name to Michael Green by deed poll to stand against Mr Shapps in his Welwyn Hatfield seat in next month’s election, in the hope of embarrassing him. Grant Shapps, pictured, created the alter ego Michael Green as part of a get-rich-quick scheme . It all adds to the perception of many of his political rivals that there is something not quite to be trusted about him. Mr Shapps, a 46-year-old father of three, was first elected in 2005. Five years later, he became a housing minister in the incoming Coalition government. Since September 2012, the qualified pilot has been Conservative Party chairman, charged with masterminding a campaign to win the 2015 general election. His supporters say he is an effective media performer; often wheeled out by party high command to defend the party’s policies. As fellow Tory MP Nick Boles said: ‘Somebody said he’s the Duracell bunny of the Conservative party. I did laugh at that because it’s a rather apt description.’ A populist politician, who is a self-confessed fan of restaurant chain Nandos, Mr Shapps is from a different background from many others in his Cabinet, which is often perceived as being populated by public school toffs. Born in Watford, he was schooled at the local grammar school. His cousin is Mick Jones, guitarist of punk rock band The Clash. Mr Shapps’ brother even played with Jones in another band, Big Audio Dynamite. Mr Shapps posted this controversial tweet after last year's Budget and was criticised for allegedly being patronising . Mr Shapps joined the Jewish youth organisation BBYO and later became its national president. At the age of 20 he was in a coma for a week after being involved in a car crash in the US. A decade later he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but went into full remission after chemotherapy. The future Tory politician studied business and finance at Manchester Polytechnic, and upon leaving university he set up a successful printing business. Later he started writing self-help guides for a website called HowToCorp, advising people on how to get rich quick – a job which has earned him a ‘loadsamoney’ nickname. He wrote the books under an alias, Michael Green – and a photograph of him wearing a badge with the name at a US conference came to light in 2012. Last month he had to admit that despite saying he had stopped using the name on election in 2005, he was still using it in summer 2006. Three years ago, claims first came to light that he had allegedly altered his Wikipedia entries; changing sentences which he said were inaccurate – such as that he was a Jehovah’s Witness. It emerged that changes were made from computers in his constituency office. And some have claimed he has followed and de-followed people on Twitter to increase the number of his followers.\n",

            "As the bright, smiling face of morning TV in the Noughties Fern Britton shocked fans when she admitted to struggling with crippling depression. The mother-of-four had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life. Things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall. And in an interview with The Telegraph on Saturday the 57-year-old revealed how close she came to suicide one day after her divorce from first husband Clive Jones. Scroll down for video . Presenter Fern Britton, who suffers from depression, has revealed how close she came to suicide following her divorce from first husband Clive Jones . The presenter and author, who has been married to her second husband TV chef Phil Vickery, 53, for fifteen years, claims she knew the marriage was never right, but remembers the time after the divorce being particularly bleak. Fern, who had three children with  Clive, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18, and has another daughter, Winifred, 13, with Phil, said: 'I remember very clearly, when they were all little and sitting around the table, all shiny-faced and having their supper, and I'd think: \"Right, you've got everything you want. Lovely! Now I'm just going to pop upstairs and kill myself.\" ' Meeting Phil whilst working on Ready, Steady, Cook was something of a salvation for the blonde, who finally came off anti-depressants last year but admits she is fully expecting to go back on them when she has another episode. Fern and husband Phil Vickery will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary next month . The couple met on the TV food show Ready, Steady, Cook . At least now she has learned to recognise the signs, telling Good Housekeeping this month: 'I haven’t had an episode for a long time. I’m cross that it’s been there and that it lurks around, but I’ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don’t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. Because I knew it would pass. People who are going through their first or second episode don’t trust that it will pass – but it really will.' Today, as she promotes her sixth novel 'A Good Catch' Fern is happy, positive and looking forward to a bright - and Botox-free - future. Phil, 53, and Fern, 57, have four children between them . The author has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully . She has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully, telling Bryony Gordon: 'I know I'm never going to look the way I did when I was 25, but I know I could look very odd. So this is what 57 is, and this is what 57 looks like. 'I'm going to stop looking back and only look forward. I've got. what, 25 years left? I'm going to enjoy them. I'm going to cycle until I am 70. I'm not going to get Botox or have things done. I'm going to show my children that this is what humans do: we get older.' The keen cyclist, who starts a three-week cycle from John O'Groats to Land's End to raise money for Genesis Research Trust next week, insists that being fit is more important to her than looking younger, saying: 'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life! I am vain about being as fit as I can be – not about my wrinkles. I’ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that – and I’ve talked myself out of it. I’d prefer to be the woman I should be. I’m 57, and I look like a 57 year-old, and I’m happy.'\n",

            "Charlie Austin is being considered for a surprise England call up for the national team’s summer fixtures after scoring 17 goals for relegation-threatened QPR. Austin is in contention because Harry Kane, who scored on his debut against Lithuania last month and made his first start against Italy in Turin, will be with Gareth Southgate’s Under-21 team. The QPR striker will continue to be monitored by England head coach Roy Hodgson and assistant Ray Lewington ahead of the friendly with Republic of Ireland on June 7 and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia seven days later. Charlie Austin, in action against Chelsea on Sunday, has scored 17 times for Queens Park Rangers this term . England manager Roy Hodgson poses for a selfie at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday evening . Hodgson has an established attack with Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge, when fit, but the unsuccessful trial of Theo Walcott up front in Italy has forced them to look elsewhere. England’s head coach, who was in Paris on Wednesday night to watch the Champions League clash at the Parc des Princes with Barcelona, has been impressed with Austin this season. Despite QPR’s battle against relegation, Austin has been consistent throughout and he is now firmly in contention for England’s summer schedule. Austin (second right) scores for Queens Park Rangers against Aston Villa earlier this month . Austin, celebrating his strike against Villa, will be monitored by Hodgson for the remainder of the campaign . The QPR forward has to resolve his own future at the end of the season after talks over a new contract at Loftus Road were put on hold until the end of the season. Hodgson’s side have a 100 per cent record in the Euro 2016 qualifiers, but it has emerged he is now looking at his options  ahead of a squad announcement next month.\n",

            "A King Charles Spaniel suffered three degree burns from a pad used to keep him warm during a scan which vets had heated up in a microwave. Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk. The pet, who is also completely deaf, had the scan, last month after his owner Lynne Edwards from Huntington in Cambridgeshire, noticed a lump behind his ear. Alfie's owner Lynne Edwards, said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back . But when Alfie returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back. She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back. Ms Edwards, 64, then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave. She said: 'I just don't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto Alfie without it being noticed how hot it was. King Charles Spaniel Alfie, who suffered three degree burns after vets place a heat pad on his back that had been warmed in a microwave . 'They have told me that they always warm them up in microwave but after what happened they have promised to change their practice. 'I am glad that they’ve now said they will do that but it took nearly a week for them to stop the practice.' Alfie is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns. Ms Edwards, an interfaith minister, is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately. The Animal Health Trust confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads. A spokesman said: 'We pioneered the use of MRI in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20,000 animals. 'In the last five years, around 3,000 of these patients would have had heat pads to maintain their body temperature. 'To the best of our knowledge, we have never seen anything like this before in any of the AHT’s patients. 'We understand how upsetting this situation must be for Lynne Edwards and her family, and have carried out a full investigation. 'We have reviewed, and are updating, our Standard Operating Procedure for the use of heat pads. 'We are also standardising the way in which all heat pads are heated at the AHT.' Alfie, who is also deaf, is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns .\n",

            "A Liberal Democrat candidate has thanked Nick Clegg for not visiting his seat because he said it would turn off voters. Josh Mason, who is standing in Lib Dem-held Redcar, said the Deputy Prime Minister was 'not the most popular'. He said that a visit from the party leader to the seat, which is currently held by the Lib Dems,would not 'do us any favours'. Scroll down for video . Josh Mason, who is standing in Lib Dem-held Redcar, said his own party leader Nick Clegg was 'not the most popular' But after Lib Dem HQ heard about the remarks he was forced to make an embarrassing U-turn. Mr Clegg has seen a dramatic collapse in his popularity since the heyday of the 2010 election campaign when he was lauded as being more popular than Winston Churchill. The party secured 23 per cent of the vote in the 2010 election. Since taking the Lib Dems into government and breaking his promise to scrap tuition fees, the party's poll ratings have slumped to single figures. Most Lib Dem MPs are choosing to keep Mr Clegg off their leaflets and instead campaign on local issues. Mr Mason told ITV Tyne Tees: 'I think that Nick Clegg coming to Redcar might be a little bit of a double-edged sword for us. 'He’s not the most popular politician in the mainstream political circuit at the moment and I’m not convinced that his presence here would actually do us many favours.' After the interview, the Lib Dems issued a 121 word statement on Mr Mason's behalf praising Mr Clegg for having 'real guts'. Mr Clegg is touring the country in a bright yellow battlebus, which stopped off in Cardiff yesterday where he campaigned with leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Kirsty Williams (pictured) Mr Mason said he was now in 'no doubt' that Mr Clegg would be 'well received' if he paid a visit. The statement said: 'Nick has shown real guts as our party leader and is someone I admire and respect. 'As Deputy Prime Minister he delivered tax cuts for low earners, more jobs and apprenticeships, and ensured real investment has come to Redcar after decades of neglect by Labour and the Tories. 'Whilst this real difference to real people’s lives has not always been given a fair hearing in the mainstream political circuit, the election campaign at last gives Nick and our party a chance to be heard directly by the public. 'As such I have no doubt that if Nick now came to Redcar and met all the people who have benefited from having the Liberal Democrats in government he would be well received.'‎ . The Lib Dems won the Redcar seat with a 5,000 strong majority in 2010 but MP Ian Swales has stepped down. Mr Clegg faces a tough fight to keep hold of his Sheffield Hallam seat and polls have predicted his party could lose more than half of its MPs.‎ .\n",

            "Poisoned by Botox? Mike and Susan Fortuna, of Shelburne are accusing Allergan of failing to warn of dangers, negligence and breach of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act in treating their daughter, Mandy . The parents of a Vermont woman who died last year have sued Botox maker Allergan, saying off-label treatment of her spams caused by cerebral palsy with Botox contributed to her death. Mike and Susan Fortuna, of Shelburne, sued last week, accusing Allergan of failing to warn of dangers, negligence and breach of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act in treating their 21-year-old daughter, Mandy Fortuna. In November, a Vermont jury awarded a New York family $6.75 million in their lawsuit against Allergan. Their lawyer said 7-year-old Joshua Drake developed epilepsy after getting Botox injections for his leg spasms caused by cerebral palsy. Joshua and Fortuna were treated by the same doctor, Dr. Scott Benjamin of Burlington, Vermont. The last set of injections occurred on September 5, 2014, approximately three weeks prior to her death, according to a press release put out last week by the Fortunas' attorneys. The Fortunas claim their daughter suffered an unexplained deterioration in her health after from Dr. Benjamin. 'She was continually gagging and choking, unable to clear her secretions,' reads the complaint. 'Her breathing was shallow and Mandy had trouble holding her head up.

The cause of death was not entirely conclusive and was ruled as atypical pneumonia, a common complication associated with Botox overdoses, according to their suit . The family obtained records from the Burlington physician, which their attorney Ray Chester says they used to determine that Mandy had received an overdose of Botox just like Joshua Drake. 'It came about seven or eight weeks too late,' Mike Fortuna told the Burlington Free Press. 'Nonetheless, we were perplexed by the whole thing. We didn't understand what had happened to her, and now we know.' Off-label: Mandy Fortuna suffered from cerebral palsy and was treated for spasms using Botox off-label . Their suit claims Botox contacted Dr. Benjamin multiple times in the 2000s and urged him to use unsafe doses of Botox for pediatric uses. In 2011, Chester and his team received what was reported to be the largest single plaintiff personal injury verdict ever awarded in the State of Virginia. That verdict was $212 million and included a $200 million punitive damages award. The case later settled for a confidential amount. According to the release, Chester's other clients range from adults who wanted to remove a few wrinkles to young children with cerebral palsy who received high dose, off-label Botox to treat spasticity. The one common thread among almost all cases is that the treatments were off-label, meaning not approved by the FDA.

            "Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has labelled Nigel Farage a 'd***' during last night's leader's debate. The former England footballer launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate. Opinion polls produced mixed results on who had 'won' the contest, with ComRes survey showing that 40 per cent of voters think David Cameron is 'most capable of leading the country', while others backed SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and others putting Ed Miliband ahead. Scroll down for videos . Leader of Ukip Nigel Farage has come under attack for his controversial comments made on the TV election debate last night . Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker labelled Mr Farage a 'd***' after claimed that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment . Mr Farage topped the list for worst and best performing leaders after his controversial comments that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. The debate spurred a flurry of reaction from footballing stars on Twitter who came out to give their opinions on the leaders. Mr Lineker tweeted: 'Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!' He took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving.' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate, tweeting: 'Unfortunately, none of these people on that stage engage with the generation of today.' The former England player took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate tweeting that the leaders had failed to engage with today's generation . The Match of the Day presenter launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate . Mr Miliband, whose hopes of using the debate to catapult him into Number 10 floundered last night, also came under fire. The Labour leader fell flat during the clash, and was left lost for words after being challenged on live TV by Nick Clegg to apologise for Labour crashing the economy. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell criticised the Labour leader on Twitter saying: 'I've captained a number of teams and it's clear to see Miliband is no leader.' While Mr Lineker suggested a different way to settle the debate. 'Can this please end with a penalty shoot-out. #leadersdabate.' It was the first time ever that leaders of the seven largest parties had gone head-to-head in a televised election debate . Both Mr Farage and Labour leader Ed Miliband faced criticism for their performances at the ITV debate . A BBC Spokesperson said: 'Gary has no involvement in any BBC programmes involving news, current affairs or politics. In common with other such presenters, therefore, he is able to express views on personal social media and that has no bearing on the BBC's impartiality.' In the first debate of its kind, lots were drawn in advance to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The seven party leaders clashed repeatedly on spending and the future of the NHS, as Mr Cameron bluntly told Mr Miliband: 'It's a service not a weapon.' Mr Farage launched into a controversial rant on 'health tourism', complaining about people with HIV who come to Britain in search of treatment. But Miss Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night as she accused Mr Farage of 'dangerous scaremongering' for blaming migrants for problems in the NHS. She told him he should be 'ashamed' of himself. Mr Farage caused outrage after he said that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell got stuck in to Labour leader Ed Miliband saying he was 'no leader' Mr Lineker suggested a more football-friendly way to end the debate- with a penalty shoot-out . He said: 'Here's a fact and I'm sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. 'There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. 'It's not a good place for any of them to be I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. 'They're both blaming each other and they're both right' - Ed Miliband on David Cameron and Nick Clegg. 'When he was in the Cabinet about half a million people lost their jobs so never mind zero-hours, with Ed there'd be zero jobs' - David Cameron on Ed Miliband. 'Nigel Farage talks about 'remember history'. The Farage family were foreigners once. I'm married to a foreigner. You are married to a foreigner' - Nick Clegg to Nigel Farage. 'What's going on here? Get real, please' - Nigel Farage to everyone else. 'The answer is investing more in homes and public services and enforcing a decent minimum wage, not scapegoating immigrants' - Nicola Sturgeon . 'You don't have to go on voting for the lesser of two evils. That's how we ended up with the tired, failed politics that we have now' - Natalie Bennett. 'It was not Polish care workers or Estonian bar workers who caused this economic crisis - it was bankers' - Leanne Wood. 'You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 a year per patient. 'I know there are some horrible things happening in many part of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.' At the end of the historic contest, Mr Miliband said: 'You've heard from seven leaders tonight. But there's one fundamental choice. 'If I'm Prime Minister I will make sure everyone will play by the same rules. If I'm Prime Minister we will cut the deficit every year. 'I believe that when working people succeed Britain succeeds. If you believe in that too, then I ask for your vote.' Mr Cameron had the last word, after drawing the final slot, telling viewers: 'I've been your Prime Minister for the last five years and all that time I've tried to have one task in mind above all others. 'And that has been turning our economy around, putting the country back to work and clearing up the mess that was left to us. 'I want to stand for another five years because I want us to finish the job that we have all started. We've created two million jobs. Let's create a job for everyone that wants and needs one.' The Prime Minister had been accused ahead of the clash of 'running scared' after dodging a head-to-head showdown with the Labour leader. After Mr Cameron objected to broadcasters' plans for three TV debates during the five-and-a-half week campaign, the ITV show marked the only occasion before the May 7 election where the Tory and Labour leaders faced each other.\n",

            "Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Let's start in Spain, where Marca and AS report that Real Madrid are set to be without Karim Benzema for their Champions League quarter-final second leg clash against rivals Atletico Madrid.

The Madrid-based newspaper claim that Ancelotti is 'hesitating' between playing a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 formation as Gareth Bale and Luka Modric also look likely to miss Wednesday's clash. Marca lead with a similar line as the heap pressure on the Madrid boss by writing, 'Ancelotti searches for a Champions League Madrid without Modric, Bale...and almost surely without Benzema.' Elsewhere is Spain, Mundo Deportivo hail Barcelona coach Luis Enrique for statistically being 'the best coach in history in his first 50 games.' Mundo Deportivo hail 'Mister Lucho' Luis Enrique for his impressive record as Barcelona manager . Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening .

            "The first lady of North Korea has appeared in public for the first time since December as part of celebrations marking the birthday of the country's founding leader Kim Il-Sung. A grinning Ri Sol-Ju, wearing what appeared to be a wedding ring on her left hand, was pictured clapping next to her smiling husband Kim Jong-un during a men's football match at Kim Il Sung Stadium on Monday, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media. Scroll down for video . Laughing with her husband, Kim Jong-un, as the pair watch a celebratory football match, Ri Sol-Ju is seen for the first time since December . The match was being held as part of a lavish series of events celebrating the 103rd birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the young leader's grandfather, which falls on Wednesday. North Korea designates the 'Day of the Sun' as a rare two-day national holiday, with art performances, exhibitions and sporting events, and pilgrimages to the late leader's birthplace in Pyongyang. A former member of the North's Unhasu Orchestra, Ri was last seen in public in December 2014, when she and her husband attended a ceremony to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-Il. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events in a break from the past, when the North's first ladies were kept out of the limelight. She was pictured wearing stylish, expensive-looking outfits and on one occasion sported what appeared to be a Christian Dior handbag, in a country plagued by chronic poverty. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events . But Ri has been out of the spotlight since December for unknown reasons. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated state for nearly seven decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Kim Il-Sung led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death on July 8, 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Il, who also ruled until his death in December 2011 when power was transferred to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un. KCNA said 'an endless stream of people' was visiting, Mangyongdae, the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung, as the 'Day of the Sun' draws near. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media . On Sunday more than 800 runners took place in an international marathon watched by hundreds of fans, including some 600 from abroad, as part of the celebrations. 'Attending the race were more than 600 marathon fans from dozens of countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Finland, UK and Italy,' KCNA said. The North announced in February that the April 12 marathon would only be open to domestic runners this year, because of lingering concerns over the Ebola epidemic in west Africa. But it last month reversed a ban on foreigners taking part in the annual run, after lifting strict travel restrictions aimed at keeping out the Ebola virus. Ri Sol-ju here is seen wearing a wedding ring and her husband Kim Jong-un an expensive watch.  Last week he appeared to be wearing a bandage on the same wrist after sustaining an injury. It has now been removed .\n",

            "Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been warned he risks creating a lost generation of supporters if he fails to invest in the club. Thousands of fans stayed away from Sunday's Barclays Premier League defeat by Tottenham at St James' Park in protest at the way the sportswear Tycoon is running the club, with the official attendance of 47,427 - the capacity of the stadium is in excess of 52,000 - understood to include many season ticket holders who did not attend. Protesters are calling for a repeat when Swansea head for Tyneside on Saturday, but Mark Jensen, editor of online fanzine www.themag.co.uk, fears longer-term consequences. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been urged to invest in the club or risk losing a generation of fans . Newcastle fans hold up 'Ashley Out' banners, mocked in the style of his Sports Direct chain of stores . Thousands of Newcastle fans boycotted the club's last game, a 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs on Sunday . Jensen, who himself stayed away from Sunday's game, said: 'I feel sorry for young people, what they are watching now and this lack of ambition. At least when I was young, the team might have been rubbish and we were going nowhere, but it was exciting to be on the terraces. 'There was so much more wrapped up in it, whereas now if the football is rubbish, I'm not quite sure what the lure is. 'That's a long-term danger. Whether Mike Ashley is here in the future or not, there's a danger that you are turning all these people off Newcastle United and going to the match, especially with the rival attraction of being able to watch it in your local pub.' Unofficial estimates have put the actual attendance for the 3-1 defeat by Spurs at significantly lower than 47,000, although some have seemed wildly optimistic. However, there is little doubt that those who answered calls for a boycott made an impact. Jensen said: 'I thought it was a massive success. Comparing it with the walk-out at the end of last season, basically it's always going to be symbolic. 'It's not going to bring Mike Ashley to his knees, but to have thousands and thousands of people, or whatever figure you want to put on it, who have already paid for something not going to the match... 'Imagine thousands of people going to Tesco or Sainsbury's and buying £30 worth of shopping and saying, 'Hang on a second, I'm not happy, you can have your shopping back'. It's a massive statement.' Last week's revelation that the club banked in excess of £34million as well as recording a profit of £18.7million for the last financial year has simply served to increase anger among fans, who have seen a squad assembled on a budget struggle to compete during the second half of the current campaign, and not for the first time in recent years. Tottenham striker Harry Kane nets his 20th league goal of the season to round off a 3-1 win over Newcastle . A fan holds up a sign protesting against Ashley's ownership as Newcastle slump to a sixth straight defeat . Newcastle midfielder Remy Cabella (left) jostles for possession with Tottenham's Paulinho (right) on Sunday . They have not been placated by head coach John Carver's insistence that there will be investment during the summer, and an increasingly vocal lobby are demanding that Ashley sells up. Jensen said: 'When you see the benefits that he's getting, as well as now profits in each of the last four years and the way that the TV income is going, to those people who say, 'Why isn't there a buyer? There isn't one' - why wouldn't there be a buyer? 'The climate of Premier League football has totally changed due to these TV deals, and so if you have got a sustainable Premier League club, especially one with the third biggest attendances, at the right price - and with a willing seller - there is definitely a buyer out there.' In the meantime, Carver faces the task of attempting to end a run of six successive league defeats, which has left the club just seven points clear of the drop zone, against the Swans. He said: 'I think there's enough experience to deal with it, yes. But we have got to stop losing players, though, sendings-off, injury...' Newcastle fans point towards the club's rude financial health amid poor performances on the pitch .\n",

            "Mothers across the globe have been left outraged by an alleged religious community that is criticizing moms for having cesarean sections instead of natural childbirths – creating a series of insulting campaign images, or memes, that claim they 'didn't really give birth'. The Facebook page of the so-called Disciples of the New Dawn has sparked an internet firestorm as thousands of mothers share, and comment on, the group's anti-cesarean memes, expressing their disgust at the outrageous messages they express; the community, led by Father Patrick Embry, is using the images to encourage fellow Christians to shame 'lazy' and 'negligent' mothers who have elected to undergo C-sections. 'Face the facts: You didn't really give birth. You caught a lucky break. Please show respect to superior women who actually had what it took to get the job done,' reads one of the group's Facebook memes, which has been shared nearly 80,000 times since it was posted on Sunday. Alarming message: This controversial anti-cesarean meme posted on the Disciples of the New Dawn's Facebook page on Sunday has been shared nearly 80,000 times . Propaganda: The religious community claims women will be 'cast into the lake of fire' if they undergo a C-section . 'Good advice from Matriarch Graber on behalf of The Circle of Matriarchs,' the Disciples of the New Dawn captioned the controversial image featuring a woman's C-section scar. The post continued: 'They have delivered many babies over the years, NATURALLY and not once has needed a C-Section or pharmaceutical toxins. Pregnancy is a beautiful thing as it is the zenith of a woman's role in a moral Christian society. If God has decided to call you home, it is not up to you or a doctor to reject Him. You may find yourself cast into the lake of fire for doing so. God's Peace [sic].' Although some reporters claimed to have spoken with Mr Embry, many question the existence of the extreme religious community and the validity of its messages. And while it remains unclear as to whether or not the page was created with the sole intention of inciting fury, its most recent postings have taken the internet by storm. Not scientific: This meme alleges that women who avoid vaccination are 'more likely' to have a natural vaginal birth . Public shaming: This meme featuring a mom in a bikini states that women shouldn't flaunt their stomachs after having cesarean sections because they didn't take care of themselves while they were pregnant . Scare tactics: The community added this picture caption to the meme to remind women that God is always 'watching' and 'judging' Thousands of women are sharing their stories and reasons for undergoing C-sections in the comment sections of the images, which claim there is 'no medical need' for cesareans. 'I am proud to have had a C-section! I was in labor for 3 days,' Barri Lynne Thomas wrote today. 'We found out my baby was stuck on my pelvis face up! If they would have simply moved her giving birth naturally I could have killed her! [sic]' Sara Jane Schwarz asked: 'How is it a lucky break? Getting a C-section means that the baby's and or the mother's life is in danger.' She continued: 'Birth is a miracle. It should not be played down or slandered like this group has done. It's a disgrace to women everywhere for this group to post such a hurtful and tactless post. It doesn't matter how one gives birth. All that matters is that there is birth of new life and everyone is safe and healthy.' Not true: This controversial meme claims that women who have C-sections 'do so because of decades of drug abuse and alcohol dependence' Unfair claims: The Disciples of the New Dawn also believe that there is 'no medial need' for cesarean sections when giving birth . Outrageous accusation: The group called women who have C-sections 'lazy' parents . 'Ignorance is bliss. May God forgive your stupidity,' Wendy Comfort added. And Cassie Wallace noted: '8,304 ppl LIKED THIS POST? See, to me, that's the scariest part... [sic]' Meanwhile, others are breathing new life into old petitions looking to remove the group's page from Facebook because of its history of 'severe hate speech' and 'sexism'. 2,500 new supporters have joined one online petition on Change.org today. 'I am signing this because of the hatred and condemnation they give to mothers who were not able to have a 'natural vaginal' birth and they are saying anyone who did not have this type of birth was due to drugs or 'being a little w****,' one woman from Texas explained. Nothing new: The Dawn of the New Disciples has a history of being accused of being sexist and hateful towards women . Dangerous thinking: The religious group claims that sticking to gender stereotypes is the key to a healthy and happy household . Impressionable minds: This disturbing image was allegedly drawn by a child and shared on the group's Junior Disciples page, which was created for younger members of the sect . She continued: 'This is very demeaning to women and mothers. It also makes claims that any mother who chose a C-section committed a SIN and should have refused it even if it mean death for both the mother and child.' Dawn of the New Disciples currently runs numerous pro-life, pro-gun Twitter accounts and Facebook pages including The Dawn Guard Militia and Junior Disciples, a community for its younger members, which features disturbing religious images allegedly created by children. One picture, which was posted in February, shows Jesus smiling while surrounded by guns. 'The Lord has given us many wonderful blessings in our life. None more precious than the God given right to bear arms. Every firearm is an extension of his hand. Every round like a heavenly embrace from Jesus himself, upon your adversary,' the group had captioned the controversial drawing. Violent thoughts: This childlike drawing shows Jesus smiling as he is surrounded by guns and a bloody knife . Loaded message: The picture was accompanied by this caption, which alleges that 'every firearm is an extension' of God's hand . Family affair: This photo of three young boys brandishing guns was shared on The Dawn Guard Militia page, which is also run by the religious community .\n",

            "A 1-year-old girl was shot in the head and left clinging to life as she sat in a car with her parents in what suburban Seattle police initially described as an apparent case of road rage. The baby was in 'very critical condition' Friday, a day after the shooting, said Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Baby Malaja was in a car seat in the back of a silver Chevrolet Impala and her parents were in the front seat when a black car pulled alongside around at 4.30pm Thursday, Kent police spokeswoman Melanie Robinson said. Scroll down for video . Innocent victim: One-year-old Malaja (left and right) was shot in the head as she sat in a car with her parents in suburban Seattle Thursday afternoon. She remains in critical condition . Target: Police say a black car pulled alongside this silver Chevrolet Impala carrying Malaja and the driver and passenger opened fire, striking the 1-year-old in the head . On the road: The shooting took place at an intersection near an apartment complex in Kent, Washington . Robinson said the driver and passenger of the black car opened fire, then drove off, but police did not give details on the possible conflict between the people in both vehicles. The shooting took place at an intersection near the Lake Fenwick Estates apartment complex in Kent. Detectives in Kent initially suggested road rage as a motive, but Cmdr. Jarod Kasner told The Seattle Times Friday that police no longer think that's the case after further investigation. Police didn't provide further details on what they believe led to the shooting. Police said the shooting was preceded by some sort of an exchange between the occupants of the black sedan and the silver Chevy. Linda Johnston, who lives nearby, ran outside after she heard gunshots. 'I was sitting in my bedroom here and heard the shots. \"Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,\"' she told Seattle television station KOMO. 'The baby was on the ground, and other people were doing CPR on the baby, and the mother was in hysterics and the dad was in hysterics, too.' Heart-wrenching: Malaja's relatives, including her aunt (right), were heard sobbing and screaming, including one enraged woman (left) who cried out: 'I want revenge!' Poignant message: The girl's uncle, Edmond McNeil (pictured), called for end of violence in Seattle . On Thursday evening, Malaja's heartbroken family said the toddler was brain dead. The girl's uncle, Edmond McNeil, came up to a KIRO7 reporter outside the hospital and delivered a powerful message on crime in the city. 'We need to stop the Seattle violence,' he said into the camera, appearing shell-shocked. 'We're trying to be living for our kids. Everybody needs to live for your kids... You ain't no gangster because you want to carry a gun. That's stupid.' Malaja's relatives were heard sobbing and screaming, including one enraged woman who cried out: 'I want revenge!'\n",

The first eruption in over four decades yesterday sent vast clouds of dust more than six miles into the air, creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region today heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is one of the most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time yesterday. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert. Scroll down for video . Ghost town: Most people have abandoned the La Ensenada locality in Puerto Varas (pictured) which has been caked in ash despite being over 18 miles away from the massive eruption at Calbuco volcano . Scared: A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas (pictured) said she saw 'the column of smoke rising up' from the volcano when she looked out of her window' Aftermath: The two violent explosions shot billions of cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere, caking nearby localities like La Ensenada in mounds of abrasive soot . Colossal: Two massive explosions from Calbuco volcano in southern Chile have shot up to ten billion cubic metres of ash over six miles into the atmosphere (pictured) Dangerous: Many people in Puerto Varas (pictured) have become worried about the damage the ash will cause to their health . Stuck: As tractors try to clear the mounds of ash that have blocked the roads, one local said: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared... We have a layer of smoke above us' Contaminated: Ash from the second blast seriously impared the visibility of drivers fleeing the city of La Ensenada (pictured) near the volcano . Isolated: A masked and hooded woman stands alone among the ash falling in the San Marin de Los Andes area near Calbuco . Evacuation: Thousands have fled their homes after Calbuco erupted unexpectedly on Wednesday and was still pouring ash into the sky on Thursday . Explosion: A second eruption from the Calbuco volcano in Chile (pictured) has forced over 4,000 people to abandoned their homes and covered nearby communities in ash . Dramatic: 4,000 people were evacuated from cities around Calbuco following a second spectacular and frightening eruption today (pictured) Eruption: Residents of Puerto Montt had a clear view of the first terrifying explosion yesterday (pictured) which threw ash and smoke a staggering six miles into the air . Spectacle: The dense ash cloud from Calbuco today created an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night sky . Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt - 620 miles south of the capital Santiago. Even Professor David Pyle who has studied over a century of eruptions across Chile's 1000-mile stretch of volcanoes ranks this one  among the strongest - and claims its ash could cross the Pacific to Australia. He ranked this particular explosion 'a three or four' on the Volcanic Explosivity Index which means it could unleash an astonishing ten billion cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere. Professor Pyle told MailOnline: 'Based on a 15km-high plume and an eruption of around an hour and a half, that’s quite strong. This particular volcano has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years. 'Sometimes it has lasted a day and other times it has bubbled on for a few weeks. The activity’s died down for the moment but we don’t know what’s going to happen next.' Many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas admitted many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' 'People went into a state of panic' as the ash cloud spread, according to Miguel Diaz who lives in Puerto Montt 14 miles away. He added: 'I heard a loud noise as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb.' Abandoned: Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured since the first explosion yesterday . Volatile: Bachelet said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people . Covered: Resident of the Ensenada locality (pictured) near Calbuco struggled to clear the mountains of ash that had built up on their rooves . Locked out: Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano . Protection: Even residents in the Argentinian city of San Carlos de Bariloche (pictured) donned gas masks to avoid the respiratory damage caused by the ash from Calbuco . Deadly: Smoke and lava spew from the Calbuco volcano, as seen from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas which is over 18 miles away . 'Even small amounts of ash can be really quite disruptive,' according to Professor Pyle who added: 'It affects power supplies and it can be disruptive to agriculture. You don’t need particularly thick accumulations of ash to start to have physical consequences.' Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured and the only person who went missing since the first explosion was found on Thursday. She said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people. The director of a radio station in Puerto Montt described how hundreds of locals rushed to get gas following the eruption, forcing stations to ration their sales. And supermarkets closed their doors to avoid being looted. LATAM airlines has cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines. A volcano in the Caulle Cordon of southern Chile erupted violently in 2011, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people. Stiff winds blew the ash from that explosion over the border to Argentina where the thick, abrasive soot coated slopes in the sky resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche. And by Thursday afternoon, much ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of the volcano. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business. 'We are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible,' said mayor Roberto Cacault. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert on Wednesday and set up an exclusion zone of 12 miles around the volcano. Ominous: The first eruption (pictured) sent a huge plume of gas and ash soaring into the atmosphere which was visible from up to 100 miles away . Active: Calbuco (pictured yesterday) is one of Chile's three most dangerous volcanoes and part of an active chain of around 500 that cover the south of the country . Incredible: Smoke and lava shot out of Calbuco yesterday as people watched on from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas (pictured) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas (pictured) went about their business as Calbuco exploded, but local authorities setting up a 12.5-mile exclusion zone around it . Destructive: Volcanoes like Calbuco (pictured) occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust . Plume: While most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava, many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash (pictured) which is pushed through the earth's crust, covering the sky . Trevor Moffat who lives in Ensenada - some six miles from the volcano - said the eruption yesterday happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Danger: Residents from nearby towns said people were crying in the streets after the volcano erupted without warning at 6pm local time . Shocking: While the first eruption occurred in the middle of the afternoon, the plume of ash and smoke was visible well into the evening from towns 100 miles away in Argentina . Blanket: The last major eruption here was in 1961 when lava flows filled the top crater before spilling down the sides and into a nearby lake . Distant: A view of the ash cloud from the Nahuel Huapi lake, around 100 miles away from the volcano in neighbouring Argentina .\n",

            "Justin Rose might just have made the most important pencil mark of his entire career to put himself in contention at Augusta this weekend. The 2013 US Open champion ended the day on seven under, sharing third place and is one of a handful of players hanging on to the coat tails of runaway leader Jordan Spieth. But it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening-day 67. Rose bogeyed three of the first four holes, finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots. And that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue. He revealed: ‘I was feeling really uncomfortable with my game, so I drew a line on my scorecard at that point, like you draw a line in the sand. Justin Rose battled back from a nightmare start and is in contention at Augusta . Rose tees off at the 18th as he now sits joint third, seven shots behind runaway leader Jordan Spieth . Rose flips his club after hitting from a trap on the 13th during a decent round for the Englishman . ‘I told myself to move on and take one shot at a time. I made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me, and after that I played with the same rhythm as the first day.’ The dramatic transformation was then followed by a spectacular back nine with birdies at both par threes, putting tee shots to within a few feet of the hole both times. And 34-year-old Rose believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend. He said: ‘I’m starting seven back and Jordan has played beautifully so far, but we all know a lot can happen. There’s magic out there on this course and it’s up to me to make something special happen.’ Maybe Ian Poulter could borrow Rose’s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter couldn’t get going. He was par for the round after bogeying the 18th and sits at one over for the tournament. He said on Twitter: ‘Really disappointed. It’s simply unacceptable and disgraceful putting — 34 putts for level par is pathetic.’ Earlier, 19-year-old Scot Bradley Neil had a tough day, shooting a 79 and finishing 13 over. He has ben tipped for big things by Rory McILroy but admitted: ‘I’d prepared well for this, but it shows my game is not good enough yet,’ he admitted. ‘I need to work hard on it if I want to get back here.’\n",

            "Amanda Knox may have finally cleared her name, but eight years of legal battles have left the Seattle native penniless, exhausted and traumatized from stress, claims her biographer. 'In prison, she was threatened with rape from a male guard, it was a really terrible experience,' says Trial By Jury author, Douglas Preston. 'I think it has really affected her, it's really hard to lead a normal life after that.' Scroll down for video . Strain and relief: Amanda Knox spoke outside her parents' home on March 27 flanked by her fiancé Colin Sutherland after she was exonerated for the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007 . Three weeks after an Italian court overturned her conviction for the 2007 murder of British student, Meredith Kercher, Preston told RadarOnline that Knox is living out a bittersweet victory. 'She went to Italy as a normal 20-year-old, West Coast girl, a soccer player, rock climber, very naïve,' says Preston about Knox's ill-fated adventure to Perugia. 'So many terrible things happened to her in Italy, so many lies were said, and the online savagery directed at her, I've never seen anything like it.' So affected has Knox been by her struggle to be exonerated by the Italian courts, that Preston hinted to RadarOnline that she is suffering PTSD and seeking professional help. 'Anyone who has been through what she's been through is going to have issues. It's like a soldier come back from Iraq, having children shot in front of him, you've been through a horrific experience. If it doesn't affect you physically, it affects you emotionally,' he says to Radar. Family struggle: Amanda Knox stands on the front porch with her fiancé, her mother Edda Mellas and stepfather, Chris Mellas. According to her biographer, Knox and her family have spent millions fighting her conviction . On top of her fight to be declared innocent, Preston claims that Knox has been ravaged financially by legal fees. This despite receiving a reported $4 million advance for her 2013 book, Waiting To Be Heard. 'The ordeal has been hugely emotional, but the financial impact has been catastrophic,' says Preston. 'Amanda received a $4 million advance for her book, that money has all gone, immediately out of the door to pay legal fees and there is nothing left,' Preston explains. 'She really wants to establish that she's innocent in Italy, they've paid a lot of fees to Italian lawyers.' Knox, 27, fought the Italian legal system for eight years, spent four years in prison and went through three appeals until she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in late March for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Shared experience: This split picture shows Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, arriving with penitentiary police to a court hearing in Perugia September 26, 2008 . Beginning of her nightmare: Amanda Knox leaves with penitentiary police after a court hearing in Perugia in September 2008 after she and her ex-boyfriend were arrested for the murder of Meredith Kercher . Kercher was discovered in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Kercher in November 2007. The British student had been stabbed four times and her throat slit in what the Italian courts claimed was a sex-game gone wrong. Knox and Sollecito was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 26 years behind bars, but were acquitted in 2011. Knox immediutely returned to the United States protesting her innocence, but in January 2014, the Italian courts overturned that acquittal and reinstated the guilty verdict. However, the case ultimately went to the Supreme Court and their conviction was overturned. Tears: Amanda Knox breaks down after hearing she had been acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in October, 2011 . Return home: Amanda Knox pauses emotionally while speaking during a news conference at Sea-Tac International Airport, Washington after landing there on a flight from Italy, October 4, 2011 after her acquittal . On the announcement of her innocence, Knox appeared on her Seattle doorstep to make a statement. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas, sister, Deanna Knox, and fiancé, Colin Sutherland, the 27-year-old broke down in tears as she told the press: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' Amanda Knox could now receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher. The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007. It is thought that Knox will return to Italy, despite having vowed never to, and will write about the country's legal and judicial system while she is there. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. Both Knox (above) and Sollecito could now seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito’s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' She added that she was 'full of joy' following Italy's highest court's decision to overturn her murder conviction, saying: 'I'm incredibly grateful for what has happened. For the justice I have received, for the support I have had from everyone, from my family and my friends to strangers.' Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who has said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement, saying she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.'\n",

            "Britain's youngest sex swap patient has resorted to working as an escort - to pay for her treatment. Rihanna Cooper, 21, from Hull, hit the headlines when, at 16, she became the youngest person in Britain to be accepted for gender reassignment. But part way through her treatment, the stress of her transition from male to female became too much and she  called a halt to it. Scroll down for video . Transgender woman Rihanna Cooper, 21, is paying for her gender reassignment herself . Now, having realised she can't go on as a man again and having to  pay for her treatment privately, Rihanna is working as an escort to fund her dreams. She said: 'Working as an escort can be dangerous and frightening. It's exhausting sometimes too. 'But it's the only way I have of earning enough money to become a woman.' Her initial treatment, and her subsequent decision to abandon the reassignment programme, sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed to swap sexes in the first place. But Rihanna insists that her decision was the right one - and blames NHS psychiatrists and doctors for clouding her focus. Rihanna was born Bradley Cooper in January 1994, and grew up with her mum, Elaine, 46, and three sisters, Claire, now 29, Katy, 26, and Sophie, 23. Born Bradley Cooper, Rihanna realised she was born in the wrong body and at 16 was accepted for treatment . Rihanna says: 'From an early age, I wanted to play with my sisters' Barbie dolls. My mum bought me Action men but I wasn't interested. 'I used to love watching her put make-up on. I was always stealing her lipstick. 'At school, my friends were all girls and I loved playing netball. 'I knew I had been born in the wrong body and I wanted so desperately to be a girl. 'I was an angry kid, because I was so confused, and though I was never bullied, I got into trouble, and I ended up expelled from school.' At 15, she announced that she wanted to become a girl. She says: 'It was hardly a shock. My family had always known. My mum and sisters were very supportive.' At 16, Rihanna was referred for specialist psychiatric assessments and she began dressing and living as a girl, painting her nails and growing her hair. However Rihanna, pictured centre with her mother and sister, said she actually wanted to be a boy part way through her NHS treatment - sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed . But Rihanna blames NHS medics for clouding her focus - and says she does want to be a woman . Her story hit the press as she became Britain's youngest sex-swap patient. But she rebelled against the treatment programme. She says: 'I hated the psychiatric treatment. I felt as though I was being made to justify why I wanted to be a girl, like they wanted to catch me out almost. 'I knew I was a girl inside, and to me, it was that simple.' At 17, she began a course of hormone injections but stopped the treatment after two suicide attempts. She says: 'The whole thing just got on top of me. I was sick of travelling to my appointments where I felt everyone was trying to catch me out and trip me up. 'I felt so alone, so isolated. I just wanted to be happy. My treatment caused a lot of stress in my family and I just wanted everything to go back to how it was.' Her full transgender op, scheduled for January 2013, was called off and she returned to living as a young man - but says she soon realised she could not live a lie. She is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately, using her work as an escort to fund her surgery. She is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately, using her work as an escort to fund her surgery . Rihanna hasn't asked the NHS to fund this reassignment, and doubts they would, because she pulled out last time. She also feels the psychiatric assessments were too invasive and the NHS programme was too invasive, so she wants to fund it herself. First on her list is a £4,500 breast enlargement, followed by surgery to remove her male genitalia. Rihanna says: 'I've always wanted to be a girl and that has never changed. I was born in the wrong body. 'My work as an escort is not ideal, but it is virtually impossible for me to get any kind of work, because of the stigma which surrounds transgender people. I see this as my only chance to fulfil my dreams.' The following is part on an NHS guide . If your child is under 18 and thought to have gender dysphoria, they will usually be referred to a specialist child and adolescent Gender Identity Clinic (GIC). Currently, the only specialist clinic for young people with gender identity issues is run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London, although they occasionally provide satellite clinics in other parts of the country. Staff at these clinics can carry out a detailed assessment of your child, to help them determine what support they need. SOURCE .\n",

            "It is not the first advertising billboard in which a company has used the image of a svelte, bikini-clad model to sell its wares and it probably won’t be the last. But something about this poster for Protein World diet supplements has struck a collective raw nerve. The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign — including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat. Scroll down for video . Protein World's billboard campaign advertising diet supplements features a svelte bikini-clad model asking 'Are you beach body ready?' Campaigners launched a scathing attack on the protein supplement company after the advert — which features a toned model posing with the slogan ‘Are you beach body ready?’ — began appearing on the London Underground three weeks ago. The ‘body shaming’ campaign has seen many of its posters defaced with feminist slogans, more than 50,000 people sign a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest. But yesterday the company’s marketing boss claimed the firm is ‘just trying to make the nation healthier’. Richard Staveley, Protein World’s head of global marketing, added: ‘It’s been a brilliant campaign for us and I don’t see us changing anything dramatically any time soon.’ Richard Staveley, Protein World’s head of global marketing revealed that the company has received bomb threats in the wake of the campaign but said it had been 'brilliant' and that he didn't see the company changing . On ITV’s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert ‘a little bit anxiety-inducing' On ITV’s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert ‘a little bit anxiety-inducing’. And the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed it had received 277 complaints, with many commenting that ‘the advert is offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image’. Posters have been vandalised with feminist messages such as ‘Your body is not a commodity’. Photographs of the amended signs have gone viral online. Despite the controversy, earlier in the week the company announced on Twitter it had made sales of £1 million and attracted 20,000 new customers in just four days following the advert’s release. Protein World has taken a strong stance on social media during the furore and has posted blunt replies to complaints on Twitter, including ‘why make your insecurities our problem’ and ‘grow up’. The company’s CEO and founder, Arjun Seth, has even branded the people defacing his adverts ‘terrorists’, ‘irrational and extremist’. But the poster has struck a collective raw nerve with many of the billboards being vandalised with people writing messages reinforcing that every 'body' of any shape, size and age is ready for the beach -  such as #eachbodysready . Pictured of the defaced posters have appeared on Facebook, such as this which someone had covered with a note which reads: '1 You're body is fine just as it is. 2 Whatever it looks like your body is not a commodity #Everybody's ready #Everyday sexism' Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Mr Staveley said his company had received a series of threats, including one to bomb its head office. He said: ‘First, we’ve been inundated, as you’ve probably seen from our Twitter feed and Facebook, of people defacing adverts, ripping them down and climbing over rail tracks to graffiti them. ‘That’s criminal behaviour. I think that’s quite extreme behaviour. ‘We’ve actually had threats on our head office, physical, violent threats. We had a bomb threat.’ More than 52,300 people have signed a petition demanding the adverts are removed. Demonstrators plan to congregate at London’s Hyde Park on Saturday for a protest dubbed ‘Taking back the beach’. On a Facebook page calling on people to attend the demonstration, a post reads: ‘The idea that your body should be hidden away if it doesn’t meet these bizarrely specific requirements . . . I’m over it.’ The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign — including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat . More than 50,000 people have already signed a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest . When Miss Reid asked Mr Staveley about claims the posters make women feel anxious, he replied: ‘We’re advertising our weight-loss collection. That’s what millions of people are aspiring to do in time for their summer holiday — to lose a bit of weight, feel a bit healthier and get fitter. It’s not a new concept.’ He confirmed the model in the picture, Australian Renee Somerfield, 23, had achieved her enviable physique using Protein World products, and denied the image had been retouched or altered. A spokesman for Transport for London said the adverts will be taken down from today — not because of the controversy, but because they have ‘come to the end of their natural three-week advertising lifespan’. Sioned Quirke, a specialist dietitian based in South Wales, said: ‘Some people do find that increasing their protein intake can aid weight loss. ‘But generally, taking a supplement or diet pill will not do all the work for you. ‘Also, these kinds of products are not regulated or monitored, so you can never be 100 per cent sure what is actually in them.’ Online fitness store Protein World, who claim that the image is entirely unPhotoshopped, have been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Tweeters .\n",

            "It has long been considered the most expensive place in the UK to buy property, but it seems London is being pipped to the post by coastal Salcombe. According to data, analysed by Harbour Hotels, the average cost of property in London - a whopping £638,217 - actually falls below that of the Devon enclave. The seaside town in the South Hams district boasts a skyrocketing average property price: £671,759. According to new data, the average cost of property in Salcombe, Devon, now tops the average cost in London . This is more then the average cost of property in some of the UK's most expensive cities, including Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. And for those who want a room with a water view, that will cost you even more. The average value of a waterfront property in Salcombe tops £2million, putting it ahead of some of London's priciest postcodes, including Notting Hill and Regent's Park. In the west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, prices average £1,629,495, while Regent's Park comes in with an average property value of £1,338,467 and Hampstead Heath close behind at £1,270,274. In the pricey west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, property prices average £1,629,465 . Regent's Park comes in with an average cost of £1,338,467 and Hampstead Heath (pictured) at £1,270,274 . In Salcombe, property facing the estuary cost as high as £2 million, with non-sea views tallying £671,759 . Salcombe made headlines last spring when it was named Britain's most expensive seaside resort. Since then, property prices have continued to soar, increasing ten per cent in the last 12 months alone, which puts Salcombe's property market on par with London's 11 per cent yearly increase. Nearby seaside competitors, like Sandbanks, Aldeburgh and Padstow, however, have seen a dip in prices of about eight per cent on average. Property prices in Salcombe have soared 10 per cent in the last 12 months, while Padstow has seen an 8 per cent decrease . To visit Salcombe - without parting with millions of pounds - the Salcombe Harbour Hotel has rooms from £425 . With summer quickly approaching, many UK travellers will holiday in Salcombe to soak up a bit of sun and the million pound view. In fact, the most recent assessment places a view of the Salcombe estuary as being worth £1.3 million, given the average property cost of over £600,000 and an average waterfront property price of £2million. Known as 'Chelsea-on-Sea,' the idyllic waterside community is a yachting and sailing paradise, and home to fresh seafood and many stunning beaches. For those who fancy a taste of the millionaire lifestyle - without the accompanying price tag - the Salcombe Harbour Hotel & Spa has waterfront rooms priced from £425 this summer season.\n",

            "Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim. The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-IT classes. However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim (stock image above) Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users. She worked with 352 students at a Midwestern suburban school district during the research. Miss Blackwell said the findings suggest it’s the ‘collaborative learning around the technology that made the difference, not just the collaboration in and of itself’. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher in a test than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users (stock image above) She added: 'Schools might reconsider how the tablets are used, especially in earlier grades, in order to make the technology most effective.' She is due to present her findings at the 65th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association in Puerto Rico.\n",

            "Jenson Button could do no more than 'look at the positives' in the wake of another frustrating day at the wheel of his faltering McLaren. After stopping on track in each of the practice sessions on Friday due to technical issues, Button made it a hat-trick in qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix. After just three corners of the Bahrain International Circuit, the 35-year-old ground to a halt with what the team believe to be another electrical issue. Jenson Button was given a lift back to the pits on a motorcycle by a marshal after his engine failure . In first practice on Friday, the engine in Button's car cut out at the first corner of his opening quick lap due to an electrical failure, and then come FP2 a sensor issue forced him to pull over. Racing director Eric Boullier insists the problems are 'unrelated', and 'just glitches stopping the car'. The latest glitch, however, means Button will start the race 20th and last - his lowest grid slot since the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, when he was driving for current power-unit suppliers Honda. In contrast, and on the upside, team-mate Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season and will start 14th. Describing his emotions, Button said: 'We're racing drivers and you want to drive your racing car as fast as you can. 'Obviously when you are limited to running in P1 and P2, with two stops on the circuit, it's tough. 'But given how things felt this weekend, in terms of driving the car this morning, it felt pretty good. Button jumps out of his McLaren after failing to complete the qualifying session in Bahrain . 'I was quite happy with it. I ended up 11th. It's still only P3, but it was a good feeling. 'With Fernando in qualifying, our best qualifying getting into Q2, you have to look at the positives. 'You would say we're definitely making progress - we're improving every race we go to - but just a tough weekend on my side of the garage.' Alonso finished just four tenths of a second off reaching the top-10 shoot-out, but concedes he needs a helping hand if he is to finish in the points. The double world champion said: 'We're a little closer than any other race this year, but we have to keep our feet on the ground. Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season . '(On Saturday) we were 14th fastest, so (on Sunday) if nothing happens we will be 14th fastest in the race probably. 'This is not enough to be in the points. We know our limitations are still there, so we will try to do our best. 'Races can change quickly. Some things can happen at the start, with pit stops, so we will take any opportunity we have. 'The main priority is to finish the race, hopefully with both cars, to learn as much as we can with this car. 'The position at the end will depend on many factors, and probably a little bit it depends on the others as well. 'If we want some points probably we need some help.'\n",

            "Nairobi, Kenya  (CNN)Kenya froze dozens of accounts linked to suspected terror supporters after militants massacred 147 people last week at a university in Garissa. The government is tracking the finances of people suspected of ties to Al-Shabaab, the militant group that claimed responsibility for the Thursday attack. So far, the government has frozen 86 accounts, but that number could go up, said Mwenda Njoka, a spokesman for the  Interior Ministry. The government has tracked supporters of the terror group since 2011, and efforts to freeze their assets have gone on since then. It has a list of suspects from various parts of the country, but mostly in Nairobi and Mombasa, he said. Kenyans mourned the victims of the attack Tuesday night at Nairobi's Uhuru Park, where hundreds gathered. Organizers unloaded 147 crosses, some draped with the nation's flag, as candles flickered in the dark. Of the fatalities, 142 were students at the university, and the rest were security forces and campus security. \"I can't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying,\" said Mary Wambui, 32, who lives in Nakuru, hundreds of miles from Garissa. \"They were just children. They were trying to make a better life for themselves. Some were first to go to college in their communities. They died trying to get an education.\" Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber, Kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims. They shared pictures of beaming faces, full of life and energy, in happier days. They talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children's bodies. Some students remain unaccounted for, and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues. Kenyan authorities have not released the names of the victims. Kenyan authorities had prior intelligence that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport, a police source said Monday. The frozen accounts is the latest in a series of actions as the government faced heavy criticism for the siege, which lasted hours. A spokesman for President Uhuru Kenyatta said authorities \"got the job done\" and saved lives. The university had about 800 students. \"With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,\"  Manoah Esipisu said. Kenya also launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, according to a military source, who said they were not retaliation for last week's massacre. \"The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011,\"  the source said Monday. Kenya has also offered 20 million Kenyan shillings, or about $215,000, for information on the whereabouts of Mohamed Mohamud, who allegedly organized the attack. Mohamud is a senior Al-Shabaab leader known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, authorities said. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, and its violence has spread to Kenya before.  In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, leaving 67 people dead. The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants. CNN's Joseph Netto reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta.\n",

            "A four-year-old child climbed under a temporary bike rack along Pennsylvania Avenue triggering Secret Service to put the White House under lockdown. The unidentified child caused the presidential residence to be closed off for a few moments on Sunday afternoon. 'Child was fine and was safely reunited with parents' following the incident, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN. A four-year-old child climbed under a temporary bike rack along Pennsylvania Avenue triggering Secret Service to put the president residence under lock down for a few moments . The incident is the second lockdown in Washington only a day after a man shot and killed himself on Saturday. The man died after shooting himself on the west front of the Capitol building just after 1 p.m., Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said. No one else was hurt. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said the man had a backpack and a rolling suitcase, triggering an hours-long lockdown, and a sign that said something about 'social justice.' Witness Robert Bishop told CNN it said something about taxing the '1%.' Bomb squad members respond to reports of a suspicious package on the West Front of the US Capitol,  on Capitol Hill on Saturday. A man carrying a backpack and rolling suitcase shot himself while carrying a sign about taxation. Authorities do not believe there is a terrorism connection . Robert Bishop of Annapolis, Maryland said he was biking near the steps of the Capitol when the suicide happened. Bishop didn't witness the suicide but said there were about 60 people in the area, and that some of them did, including a girl and her mother who immediately began crying afterward. Bishop said another witness told him and a police officer that the man who killed himself held up a protest sign about taxation just before pulling the trigger. The lockdown came during Washington's annual Cherry Blossom Festival, which attracts thousands of tourists during Washington's busy season. Congress has been on spring recess for two weeks and lawmakers are set to return to work Monday. Busy day: The suicide came on one of the busiest days for tourist in the U.S. Capitol as travelers from the world over flock to the yearly cherry blossom festival . January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the drone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.\n",

            "The Philadelphia Office of Transportation aims to get the city's pedestrians off their phones by sending a man in bubble wrap out to spread their safety message to the people. A video from the office features characters in 'safety suits' including Bubbleman, a 'Fashionista' wrapped in the poppable material and a young man in flashing lights. The campaigners are seen talking to residents about the dangers of not looking up from one's phone, including the fact that 37 people died from being hit by cars last year. While other safety programs are directed at keeping motorists from hitting and killing pedestrians, the City of Brotherly Love's is focused on those walking around the city. Scroll down for video . A video from the Philadelphia Office of Transportation shows characters such as Bubbleman talking to residents about the dangers of phone usage while walking around the city . A character called the Fashionista (center, in bubble wrap) said 'jaywalking is the new catwalking' as part of a snarky reminder to pedestrians to be aware of their surroundings . It is aimed at 18 to 25-year-olds who the campaign says are most likely to be hit by cars while on their phones. More than 40 per cent of drivers who hit pedestrians and 30 per cent of the 1,800 pedestrians that are hit are 18 to 34, Mayor's office planner Ema Yamamoto said, according to Plan Philly. The snarky video's Safety Suiter characters say they 'can't think of any other way to not get hit by a car' besides wearing their ridiculous costumes. Another character, the Fashionista, says that 'jaywalking is the new catwalking'. A 'Tech guy' in a helmet with flashing lights on his body also gave information to residents, including that 37 pedestrians died last year . The SafetySuiters (played by different actors) are part of a campaign to drive down pedestrian deaths among young people, based around a series of slogans including 'It's road safety, not rocket science' Large signs in Philadelphia that say 'Pick Your Head Up'  are also part of the bid to end phone use, which is thought to contribute to five people being hit per day. The campaign, which has more slogans such as  'It's road safety, not rocket science' and 'jaywalking can lead to not walking', also includes signs meant for drivers on its website. One says 'Cars have bumpers, people don't'. Some have criticized the Philadelphia campaign for focuses too much on pedestrians and blaming them for getting hit by cars. Twitter user JonasMcivitas called the ads 'tone deaf'. 'Certainly everybody is responsible for paying attention to their surroundings. But a car can kill people. Drivers should be a million times more the focus of this campaign because a driver bears the responsibility for not killing people,' local planner Victoria Harris said. Some have found Philadelphia's safety slogans such as 'jaywalking can lead to notwalking' to be 'tone deaf' Some pedestrian advocates and urban planners have criticized certain safety education efforts for placing blame on those who are hit by cars. Above, a campaign in Montgomery County, Maryland . The pedestrian safety coordinator for Montgomery County said that the graphic campaign was to help humanize pedestrian victims of accidents . Yamamoto said that the new campaign was simply explaining good behavior for smartphone users, who 'need to be aware of their surroundings'. Backlash against the campaign follows a similarly controversial public education effort in Montgomery County, Maryland, outside of Washington DC. Posters with tire marks over young people's faces were seen as blaming them for their own deaths, though the pedestrian safety coordinator told WTOP that the Street Smart campaign was an attempt to humanize victims. New York City's Vision Zero campaign against accidents, which has included speed limit reductions, focuses on drivers. The metropolis saw 132 pedestrians die last year, the lowest number on record, according to the New York Times.\n",

            "A new Islamic fatwa in Turkey has decreed that Muslims are allowed to use toilet paper. The Directorate of Religious Affairs for Turkey stated that the use of the material for hygiene is acceptable but water was preferable. Islamic teachings traditionally state that followers should use water to clean themselves  after going to the toilet. A new Islamic fatwa in Turkey has decreed that Muslims are allowed to use toilet paper . The set of rules for how Muslims should relieve themselves, called the Qadaa al-Haajah, was established in the times before toilet paper or toilet seats were invented. Use of the left hand or three stones was also permissible. The code also states that followers should not speak or read while on the toilet and should enter with their left foot and leave with their right, speaking a prayer. The Directorate of Religious Affairs for Turkey stated that the use of the material for hygiene is acceptable but water was preferable . Men and women are also told not to stand while relieving themselves but to squat or sit. The new announcement, reported by Hurriyet Daily News, stated: 'If water cannot be found for cleansing, other cleaning materials can be used.' 'Even though some sources deem paper to be unsuitable as a cleaning material, as it is an apparatus for writing, there is no problem in using toilet paper. Last month the Directorate of Religious Affairs had also relaxed rules on around the use of products containing alcohol - as long as they were not consumed. Hand sanitizes and other similar products used for hygiene products are now halal. 'While it is forbidden to drink substances containing alcohol that were produced for cleaning purposes, it is acceptable to use them for cleaning,' Hurriyet Daily News reported. The fatwa stated that places that had been cleaned with the products would not need to be washed again with water prior to performing prayer. A new ruling on begging, stating that anyone who begs and earns money beyond their immediate needs is 'demanding the fire of hell.' The code, known as Qadaahul Haajah, is part of a set of guideline based on the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Although they are not compulsory, many devout Muslims follow the Sunnah teachings. -The rules state Muslims must say before entering the toilet 'In the name of Allah, O Allah! I seek refuge with You from all offensive and wicked things' -They must enter with their left foot and leave with their right saying a second prayer 'Praise be to Allah who relieved me of the filth and gave me relief' -People should not speak, greet anyone else or read while they are relieving themselves . -Muslims should not go to the toilet standing up but should squat or, if necessary, sit . -Followers must not face the direction of Mecca while they go to the toilet or have anything bearing the name of Allah or the Quran on them . -People should relieve themselves out of sight of people and should not look at their own genitals or anyone else's . -After going to the toilet, Muslims should clean themselves with the left hand and water . -Stones are also permissible, and three stones should be used to wipe themselves . -The hands should then be washed .\n",

            "A prankster who pretended he had put his girlfriend's dog in a washing machine got a very painful comeuppance after she glued him to a chair- naked. Dominika Petrinova, from the Czech Republic, was furious after her boyfriend Erik Meldik's prank, which went viral after he posted it online. The 27-year-old had burst into tears when she was told her dog Sam had accidentally been put in the wash before Mr Meldik revealed the 'joke' and that her beloved pet was safe and sound. Ouch! Erik Meldik screamed in pain as he tried to pull himself free after being glued to a chair by his girlfriend . Dominika Petrinova decided to get her painful revenge by gluing wax strips to the plastic chair after her boyfriend's previous prank where he told her that their pet dog called Sam was in the washing machine . So Ms Petrinova had decided to exact her revenge in a painful prank of her own. This hilarious video shows her setting up the gag by super gluing the waxing strips to a plastic office chair. She then cruelly promised her boyfriend, who had celebrated his birthday the day before, a special treat. Ms Petrinova then led him - naked and blindfolded - into the room and onto the booby-trapped chair. After cruelly telling him she has a birthday surprise in store, Ms Petrinova blindfolds her naked boyfriend before getting him to sit down on the booby-trapped seat . Trapped: The realization sinks in that Erik Meldik is stuck that he glued to the chair by the waxing tape on his genitals . It takes a few moments for him to realise what  happened while Ms Petrinova was heard laughing in the background. Panic then flashed across his face as he clicked he was stuck to the chair by his genitals and he asked his giggling girlfriend: 'Are you kidding me? You are pranking me now? Mr Meldik, 31, cried and screamed as he tried to free himself, before he eventually ripped himself off the chair, leaving a fair portion of skin and hair behind in the process. Ms Petrinova films her partner Mr Meldik as he tries and fails in his attempts to free himself from the office chair . Mr Meldik sheds a tear when he realises that he is well and truly stuck and will have to rip himself free . The victim of the prank and his friend Cenek Styblo, 29, are known in their Czech homeland as 'the Viral Brothers' and are famous for carrying out stunts often on each other or their respective girlfriends. But Ms Petrinova said she had decided the dog in the washing machine stunt was too much, and wanted to teach her boyfriend a painful lesson that he would not forget in a hurry. She said: 'I was really upset when I thought Sam was in the washing machine, and he was running after me saying he was sorry but he clearly wasn't because he was filming it and put it all online. 'Well, now I am pretty sure he is genuinely sorry.' He screams as he uses a set of drawers to try and yank himself off the strips which are stuck to his genitals . He finally pulls himself free leaving behind a fair portion of skin behind on the waxing strips in the process . In recovery: Mr Meldik cries as he lies on the bed after the painful prank which was carried out in revenge for an earlier stunt where he pretended to accidentally have put his girlfriend's dog in the washing machine . The 27-year-old had burst into tears when she was told her dog Sam had accidentally been put in the wash before Mr Meldik revealed the 'joke' - prompting her to seek revenge .\n",

            "Benik Afobe’s first-half finish kept Wolves slim dreams of promotion alive and helped push 10-man Wigan to the brink of relegation after a tense clash at the DW Stadium. Afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves Wigan on the verge of dropping into English football’s third-tier after a dreadful season. To make matters worse, the Latics will have to face Brentford next weekend without star man James McClean who received his marching orders in injury-time for a second bookable offence. Wolverhampton's Benik Afobe (right) celebrates scoring the winner in a 1-0 defeat of Wigan . The Latics had James McClean sent off for a second bookable offence in jury time . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Pearce, Perch, Maguire; Boyce, Chow (Cowie 79), Kvist (Fortune 56), Bong, Bo-kyung; McClean, Pennant (McKay 68) Subs not used: Al Habsi, Taylor, McCann, Cowie, Barnett . Booked: Boyce, Bong, Fortune, McClean (sent off) Wolves: Kuszczak; Iorfa, Ebanks-Landell, Stearman (c), Golbourne; Edwards, McDonald, Price, Sako (Hause 82); Afobe, Dicko (Doyle 82) Subs not used: Flatt, Doherty, Henry, van La Parra, Jacobs . Booked: Iorfa, Stearman and Dicko . Scorer: Afobe 25 . Referee: J Linington . Attendance: 16,810 . The Latics now have to hope Rotherham fail against Reading on Tuesday and Leeds United next weekend while they win at Griffin Park on the last day of the season. Wigan’s dire position represents a spectacular downfall for the north-west club who lifted the FA Cup just 712 days ago and who spent eight entertaining years in the Premier League between 2005 and 2013. They once seemed to brilliantly punch above their weight in England’s top-flight but they have slipped into despair after using three managers and 42 players across this season. And, worryingly enough for their fans, if they do go down an uncomfortable summer involving an expected player exodus will almost certainly be on the cards. Yet this clash was not all about the home side as Afobe also ensured that Wolves fans can still dream of a Wembley ending to this season – but only just. The stakes for both sides in this clash could hardly have been higher as Kenny Jackett’s visitors needed three points to keep up their late scramble for a play-off spot although that now looks unlikely as they would need three points and a huge goal swing on the last day to make it into the top six. Afobe races past Wigan's Gaetan Bong as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive . Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce drops to his knees as the former FA Cup winners head towards the drop . Gary Caldwell, the former Wigan captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following Malky Mackay’s sacking earlier this month, again called for the club’s fans to meet and greet his squad at the players’ carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant. A healthy handful did just that but their pleas fell on deaf ears in a clash that just about summed up Wigan’s entire season. They home side dominated the opening moments and looked up for the challenge of beating the odds – and the drop – and McClean should have scored when he swivelled and shot from close range after seven minutes. Caldwell’s influence on Wigan has been immediate and they are playing far better football than witnessed earlier this year under either Uwe Rosler or Mackay. But killer instinct is in short supply – and it showed. Former Stoke star Jermaine Pennant was the next to test Wolves defence as his deflected effort only just went over the bar after 12 minutes but the home side were then undone shortly after with the kind of goal that underlines the chronic defensive frailties that have so affected this term. A Bakary Sako free-kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by Afobe who could not miss from three yards out as Wigan’s defence stood and watched. As news filtered around the DW Stadium that Derby were losing at Millwall, and that Wolves were just a point outside the top-six as a consequence, Jackett’s side looked to press home their advantage against a Wigan side that played attractively without any real penetration. However, neither side created any real clear-cut chances and both goalkeepers spent the remainder of the first half as spectators. After the break, Wigan again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although McClean, Pennant and Bo-kyung tried to link up and break down Wolves, they again lacked any real cutting edge. Wigan's James Perch and Wigan's Marc-Antoine Fortune head off dejected after the final whistle . Wigan supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands . However, it was the same at both ends with Nouha Dicko and Sako both having little say in the game and although Afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes, his handball in the build-up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort. With half an hour to go, Wolves should have been 2-0 up but Wigan had keeper Carson to thank for blocking Dicko as he ran through on goal. And Carson was also at his best soon after when Afobe’s corner was superbly flicked goalwards by Dave Edwards but the former England No.1 brilliantly tipped over to keep the Latics in the contest. His team-mates responded to his efforts by launching a late charge at Wolves with James Perch and McClean both looking to surge forward and get on the scoresheet. Both sets of players observe a minute's silence to mark the anniversary of the Bradford stadium fire . Last week, when Wigan threw caution to the wind against Brighton they were rewarded with a late three points and they tried the same again in this match but they could not quite manage it. And when McClean picked up a second yellow in the dying moments , Wigan’s hopes left the field with him. Both these teams can still get what they want out of this season. But only just. And next Saturday will have to be really, truly remarkable if that is to happen.\n",

            "Michael Vaughan has confirmed that he has held talks with the ECB over becoming England’s new supremo as the governing body’s new regime move closer to replacing Paul Downton. The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday’s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket . Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice . Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . ‘I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,’ said Vaughan. ‘We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. ‘It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I’ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,’ Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. ‘I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I’m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. ‘I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don’t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.’ Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators . Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role . That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. ‘I am loving my job at the moment,’ said Vaughan. ‘I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.’ It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC’s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship . Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket . Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen — says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He’s only interested if there’s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator – and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes — and 26 Test wins overall, a national record. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Joe Root is a particular favourite — he is next in line to replace Alastair Cook as Test captain. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Vaughan is interested in the job in principle, and is close to incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He may decide he’s enjoying his media career too much to risk entering firing line.\n",

            "A restaurant customer in the Mexican border town of Tijuana was left horrified after witnessing staff butchering a dog to be served up as a pork dish on the menu. The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant in southern Tijuana following a tip-off from the disgusted client. The customer called in the cops after witnessing kitchen staff killing the dog, later intended to be served up masquerading as pork in the next chow mein. Scroll down for video . Disgusted: A restaurant customer in Tijuana was left horrified after witnessing staff butchering a dog to be served up as a pork dish on the menu. Pictured is a dead dog police recovered at the establishment . The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since local police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant (pictured) in southern Tijuana . Officers conducting a raid of the restaurant on Wednesday morning discovered caged dogs in the kitchen, a decapitated puppy in the trash and the owner himself in the process of decapitating and butchering a canine carcass, putting the meat in a cooking pot. Owner Yu Yu Chou told local newspaper reporters: 'I admit to killing the dog, but the meat is for my own personal use, not for my customers.' Police received a tip-off from a restaurant client who heard the sounds of a howling dog at the back of the establishment. After peeking over the back fence to investigate, the horrified client witnessed two cooks in the act of killing the defenceless animal. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality . An official was filmed pulling a beheaded dog from a storage barrel during the raid . Boast: The restaurant advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' but has had complaints from customers before about flies and cockroaches in their food . Rescued: Some dogs were found alive at the restaurant and were taken away by a local vet . Lucky: This dog was saved from the owner's knives by the police. The picture is a grab from a local news agency video of the property . Upon arrival at the scene, police officers said they witnessed the cooks hurriedly throw a decapitated dog carcass in a kitchen waste bin. Officers later saw the owner decapitating and butchering a dog in the back alley. The restaurant, which advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' claims never to have received complaints of using dog meat before. The owner, while handcuffed in the back of a police vehicle, said: 'We've had complaints from customers who have found hair, flies or cockroaches in their food, but never anything this serious.' The AFN news agency took video evidence of the police bust. It contains footage of a hair-strewn alley where the dogs were seen being butchered, a terrified dog chained to the wall and a forensics officer pulling a decapitated canine carcass – stiffened by rigor mortis – out of a kitchen waste bin. The animals, some of which survived, were removed from the scene in a veterinarian's van. Samples of meat were also taken from the kitchen fridges in order to determine the origin of the meat. Following local authorities' demands to investigate kitchens in other local oriental eating establishments, five other Chinese restaurants in the area did not open their doors to customers on Wednesday, leading many to question whether the cooking of dog meat has long been practiced in Tijuana. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality. A spokesman for the Mexican Ministry of Health told local reporters following the incident that the city would be pursuing conviction of the Mr Yu Yu Chou, and that 'you can't play with the health of Tijuana'. The infamous frontier town in Baja California state sits directly on the United States border, just three miles from downtown San Diego. The town has long had a dangerous reputation, not least for the criminal cartel activity which sees drugs and humans trafficked across the border into the United States.\n",

It is thought the pressures of becoming part of the Royal Family put a strain on Miss Bonas's relationship with Prince Harry (above). She has long dreamed of becoming an actress and wanted to pursue her career freely . ‘I think as you get older, you find out more and more about yourself and what you like and what you don’t like,’ she adds. The interview follows the release of a short film last month for the fashion house. It features Miss Bonas, 26, dancing round an old court house and English country garden in a £1,800 dress. Asked if it was ‘nice’ being single, she replied: ‘It is actually, it is, it is’ Miss Bonas dated Prince Harry for two years until last April when they broke up, reportedly over a disagreement about the costs of attending Harry’s friend Guy Pelly’s wedding in America. Since then, Miss Bonas, a trained dancer, has been focusing on her acting and modelling career. She has just finished playing Cecily in The Importance of Being Ernest at the London Oratory, the Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg’s son as a pupil. In an interview to promote her role as Mulberry’s new muse, trained dancer Miss Bonas - who also appeared on the front cover of Miss Vogue magazine for the April edition - said: ‘I’m a strong, independent woman' Mulberry has released a short film featuring Miss Bonas, 26, dancing round an old court house and English country garden in a £1,800 dress (pictured). Miss Bonas dated Prince Harry for two years until last April . The three-night production was put on by Band of Others, a London-based theatre group which is raising funds for the Action on Addiction charity, of which Harry’s sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, is patron. Indeed, Prince Harry even attended the opening night of his former girlfriend’s play, and was heard laughing loudly throughout. Last month, she also appeared on the front cover of Miss Vogue magazine, and later this year will make her film debut in Harvey Weinstein’s Tulip Fever, also starring Dame Judi Dench. ‘I hope the focus is becoming more about skills that I have,’ she said in the interview with the Sunday Time’s Style magazine. ‘It’s really important to me not just to be known as…’ she added, drifting off without finishing the sentence, presumably referring to being known as Prince Harry’s ex. She refused to discuss her relationship with the prince, only to comment on the media attention their romance prompted. ‘All that stuff is not real,’ she says. ‘It’s really important to remember that all it is is noise, noise that can be very loud at times.’ Miss Bonas is set to make her film debut in Harvey Weinstein’s Tulip Fever, also starring Dame Judi Dench . She has just finished playing Cecily in The Importance of Being Ernest at the London Oratory, the Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg’s son as a pupil. Pictured: Miss Bonas in Mulberry's short video . She said she survived the attention, and speculation about their impending engagement, by being a homebody. ‘I’m not really one of those people who’s always out. I like being at home. I suppose that helps. I’ll go out with my friends or if there’s something really amazing I have been invited to, but I won’t do that all the time because that is not who I am.’ ‘But if I ever feel like “Oh, my life” or get upset by silly things like a photographer, or if someone has written something nasty that upsets me, I just think “worse things happen at sea”,’ she added, quoting her mother, Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon’s, favourite saying. Lady Mary-Gaye, the daughter of the 6th Earl Howe, has been married four times and has five children. The blonde, 1960s socialite once posed for a coffee table book half naked and smothered in engine oil and even had a cocktail named after her at Claridge’s. 'I hope the focus is becoming more about the skills I have,' said Miss Bonas, 26, of the shift she hopes will now happen in terms of how the media and members of the public see her now that she is pursuing an acting career . Miss Bonas pictured with her former partner Prince Harry in March last year just a month before they split up . Miss Bonas is Lady Mary’s only child with from her third marriage to Jeffrey Bonas, an old Harrovian entrepreneur. Speaking about her family, Miss Bonas said she was a ‘lion’. ‘It really, really annoys me when people attack my mum, because all of it’s all false. All of it,’ she said. ‘With all of her children, whenever we have a problem or a drama, she’s always there, as a mother but also as a friend who gives really wise advice. ‘About my family, I’m a lion. I am not tough but I am strong. I am definitely not a wallflower.’\n",

            "A cake-making prodigy is set to be the next Mary Berry as she prepares to publish her second cookbook. Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at the age of three and landed her first book deal with her recipe collection Amy's Baking Year at just 14. Her second, all about entertaining, is now firmly in the works but the teenager has her sights set even higher - with plans to launch her own baking products and even become a TV chef. Already baking at five years old Amy-Beth (left) is pictured with sister Lara-Jayne, 10 . Amy-Beth started baking at three-years-old and published her first cookbook, Amy's Baking Year, at age 13 . Amy-Beth most recently hosted a cupcake-making class in Harrods, London. Britain's youngest published baker, who counts Pixie Lott and Katherine Jenkins among her fans, delighted a crowd with her recent demonstration. She then signed copies of her debut cookbook in the Toy Kingdom department for thrilled shoppers. Amy-Beth also has a regular column in OK! magazine and continues to supply other publications with tips and recipes. The keen cook, who attends Newhall School in Chelmsford full-time, makes bespoke baked goods to order in her spare time, during summer holidays and half term. But it seems the talented young baker gets it all from her mother Gillian, who taught Amy and her other daughter Lara-Jayne, 22, how to make cakes. Amy gets decorating as she shows onlookers how to perfect cupcakes at a London presentation . The young cook pictured with fans at her Harrods book signing and cupcake masterclass . Amy picked up a particular knack for baking and continued to experiment until she soon took full control of the kitchen and the entertaining. Gillian told MailOline: 'When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion, as I did when I was a child, in cooking and baking. 'She watched me cook all meals and bake birthday cakes for many members of our family from scratch. 'I always preferred to make my own cakes as I knew exactly what was going in them, they tasted nicer and they were (and still are) much appreciated. 'Amy soon wanted to venture out on her own and at aged 12 she asked if she could bake her sister Lara-Jayne's cake for her 17th birthday. 'I had planned a simple chocolate sponge cake but Amy, being more adventurous, single-handedly created a two-tiered cake covered in roll-out fondant icing. 'She then decorated it with heart shaped biscuits on sticks, which later became a recipe in her book (lollipop biscuits). 'She has quite literally surpassed me in the kitchen, a fact that I'm both proud and amazed at. 'It is sometimes hard to get into the kitchen now as Amy is often experimenting with recipes, baking for charity cake sales, or helping preparing for a party or event we are organising.' Her inventive bakes are remarkable for her age. Amy designed and made a pony-themed cake for a teacher at age 12. At age 14 she was commissioned by another teacher to make a three-tiered lace effect wedding cake. She finally baked it in chocolate at age 16 using carrot, pineapple and lemon flavours. A mini oven at Christmas could certainly have helped ignite Amy's passion for cake making . When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion in cooking and baking . Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there. The teenager said: 'I made cupcakes for regular clients as well as celebrity functions and after parties and it grew from there. 'After having seven of my recipes published in a national newspaper weekend supplements, I approached a few publishers with a mock-up of the ideas I had for my book and got the book deal at age 14.' Her book, Amy's Baking Year, features recipes themed around the four seasons and occasions such as for Mother's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas. Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother Gillian, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there . This catapulted Amy into the limelight of the baking world and opened up multiple doors for her . From cute cupcakes, French macarons, cookies, tarts and classic sponge cakes, to sticky puddings, jams and gingerbread - plus Amy's highly sought after 'perfect cupcake' recipe - there is an indulgent treat to suit every occasion. With a focus on family, the recipes are designed for both seasoned bakers and young enthusiasts. Amy's Baking Year features Amy's selected easy-to-follow recipes themed around the four seasons . The beautifully illustrated book also features tips on the perfect decoration and setting for each bake. She says: 'I have been brought up cooking and baking by my mum who is also a talented home cook and baker, as were her parents who both worked in catering.' A few of the recipes in the book such as my Grandad's Coconut Ice, and Aunty Lynn's Fudge have been passed down to Amy from members of her family. She continues: 'While I was at home experimenting with recipes my friends were spending their time on social media. 'It was something that I was passionate about so really enjoyed spending my time focusing on it. 'I think it's important that we return to traditional values and that what I try to get across through my cooking. 'The art of cooking and eating healthily is important to me, so I'm very conscious of the ingredients I cook with, but I think we're becoming too calorie obsessed. That being said I try not to eat everything I bake.' She is juggling her lucrative cooking career around studying for her A-levels in English literature, art and music. 'The school I attend doesn't offer cookery as an A Level. I hope to go on to train at Le Cordon Bleu in the future after I have finished school.' Amy says she hopes to have her next cookbook themed around entertaining on bookshelves nationwide by 2017.\n",

            "If Wigan Athletic are to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship, then their new manager Gary Caldwell would want to see them go down kicking and screaming. Martyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate. When Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points. And they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding’s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures. Millwall team-mates rush to congratulate substitute Magaye Gueye after he scored their second goal . Lions No 1 David Forde celebrates after Jimmy Abdou came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike . Martyn Waghorn was one of three players sent off - two for Wigan and one for Millwall in the fiesty clash . Millwall: Forde (c); Cummings, Nelson, Beevers, Harding; Upson, Abdou, Williams (Bailey 42), Martin (Gueye 68); O’Brien (Woolford 84), Gregory . Substitutes not used: Archer (GK); Cowan-Hall, Fuller, Taylor-Fletcher . Scorers: Abdou 75; Gueye 90+3 . Booked: Gregory, Martin, Bailey, Beevers . Sent off: Upson . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Pennant (Chow 81), Perch (c), Kvist (Ojo 90+1), Kim Bo-Kyung, McLean; Fortune (Waghorn 53) Substitutes not used: Al Habsi (GK); McCann, Barnett, Murphy . Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou’s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn’t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O’Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall’s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall’s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a ‘Cup Final’ and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell’s men. Wigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall . Millwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer . The Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: ‘That was a Millwall performance, that’s what this club is all about. If the players haven’t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now. ‘I don’t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.’ And he couldn’t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou’s scoring record after his first goal in two years. ‘Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,’ he said. ‘If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I’ve been telling him for seven years he can do that. ‘He’s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!’ With Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall’s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: ‘There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up. ‘The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.’ Wigan’s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O’Brien when he broke clear. But overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd. Wigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams . Wigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented . Within the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O’Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner. And when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall’s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header. After Gueye made sure at the end, chants of ‘Super Neil Harris’ echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?\n",

            "Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, \"it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence\". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of \"treating\" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.\n",

            "Neuroscientists have succeeded in creating 'ghosts' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected 'presence' in the room. The spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it's only our mind playing tricks. The invisible, creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed-up signals in the brain, the researchers say. Scroll down for video . The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain. 'This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain,' said Professor Olaf Blanke of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland . Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. The sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers. Under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self-perception, but lead researcher Olaf Blanke explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body. 'Most of the research predicts that we cannot tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand, of my hand, touching my body or touching one or another position. However, if this is not fully integrated because I'm doing it or if I cannot correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me; in those cases of uncertainty, very often in those cases of double touch, the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else,' said Blanke who is leading the research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL). The findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence, even a guardian angel, demon or apparition stalking their movements. These are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations, such as mountaineers and explorers, or those grieving for a lost loved one. They are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain, including epilepsy, migraine, schizophrenia and cancer. Blanke's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body, in other words a ghost sensation. MRI scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self-awareness, movement and the sense of position in space. These brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing, important for the perception of one's own body. The scientists then conducted an experiment to 'trigger' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects. Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. 'We built a robot which allows us to distort this signal, which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals. Artificial 'ghosts' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop. By having signals mixed up in their brains (shown), volunteers were made to feel that a creepy 'presence' was behind them. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing . 'And one side effect of this was, instead of saying that I'm touching myself or that I'm touching with my index finger my own body; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them. 'And this somebody else; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them, but somebody else was also present. 'So strong, that some of them decided not to finish the experiment,' said Blanke. The robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting, mixing up 'sensorimotor' brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body. Blanke said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances. The study, published in Current Biology, said that 'simple sensorimotor conflicts induced, in healthy subjects, an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive, first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia'. Blanke says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. He hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that doesn't induce neurological symptoms, but helps patients overcome such sensations. 'We are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients.' Here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment. The robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent 'ghost'. The study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, migraine and tumours . Such therapies, he says, could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down-regulate - or reduce - these feelings; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab. 'A more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set-up of the device that you have seen. So this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes; smart textiles in a way. And should there be strong manifestations in this case, one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis-regulate or to down-regulate such a state.' Two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment, the results of which appear in the journal Current Biology.\n",

            "The mother and daughter who survived a tragic car accident this week, which saw three children die, have been reunited. Aluel Manyang was moved from the intensive care unit at the Royal Children's about 5.15pm on Friday, and greeted her distraught mother, Akon Goode, with a 'big hug', her father said. 'She didn't believe that her mum was still alive,' Joseph Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for videos . Aueel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . Ms Guode visited her daughter for the first time but did not stay the night in the hospital. Mr Manyang said his daughter was expected to make a '100 per cent' recovery and she should be allowed to go home within four days. The five-year-old girl who survived when a car driven by her mother plunged into a lake believes her three siblings who died in the crash were eaten by crocodiles. Aluel Manyang believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Her siblings - one-year-old brother Bol and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger - died after their mother Akon Guode crashed her 4WD into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west on Wednesday. The crash on Wednesday killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang, says five-year-old Awel remains in a serious condition at the Royal Children's Hospital but she remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said. 'I went to see her yesterday and she was happy to see me. She knew me when I asked: 'Do you know me?' She said, 'Yeah, you're Daddy'.' Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody on Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told him she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday . Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun. 'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said. The tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children . The 2005 Toyota Kluger is expected to be removed from the lake late on Thursday morning . The family with seven children moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008 . Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. A mini shrine for the three young children grew on Thursday as families visited the area to pay their respects . Two young girls carried flowers to the lake where three three died when the car they were in crashed . Victoria police said that the exact circumstances of how the car went into the lake are yet to be determined . A resident named Michelle told 3AW that her neighbour broke open the back windscreen of the 4WD to save the children . Victoria Ambulance said the children were taken to The Royal Children's hospital via air ambulance . Further tests will be conducted in order to determine whether the car had any mechanical defects .\n",

            "A car salesman who was high on cocaine murdered a prostitute by stabbing her 44 times before raping two more women at his home while his partner enjoyed a Christmas night out. Steven Mathieson, 38, stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December. As she lay dead on the floor, the father-of-two called two more vice girls over to his family home and raped them before they managed to flee while still naked. His young son was asleep in the bedroom next door while he carried out the horrific crimes. Mathieson, who has previously been described as of 'impeccable character', pleaded guilty to murder and rape at the High Court in Glasgow today and now faces life in prison. Steven Mathieson, 38 (left), stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer, 23, (right) dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December, while his partner was on a night out . The court heard how the crimes occurred while he was left babysitting his young children while their mother - his partner of 10 years - enjoyed a night out. The family had spent the day Christmas shopping on December 4 last year and enjoyed a meal before returning home. Mathieson - described as being his 'normal self' - then dropped one of his children at his grandmother's home before returning to his house – in a quiet residential neighbourhood - with his younger son. His partner left the property for a work night out and he sent her a text which said: 'Have a good night. Love you'. However, soon after he had put their young son to bed, Mathieson used his phone to arrange for sex while his partner was out. The court heard he regularly used sex phone lines but hid it from his long-term partner. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was one of the escorts who arranged to meet him. The 23-year-old, who had arrived in Scotland just a few days earlier having moved up from London, arrived at his property at about 11pm. However, within minutes, Mathieson – who was high on cocaine - stabbed her 44 times and cut her throat. Mathieson then sent a text to his partner which said: 'Sorry xx'. His young child was asleep in the room next door while he carried out the harrowing crimes. The court heard how Ms Maurer had defensive-type injuries suggesting she had tried to fend off her killer. Two other escorts, who Mathieson had summoned, then arrived at his home, completely oblivious to the murder which had taken place. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was stabbed 44 times by Mathieson and had her throat cut . When they arrived, they found Mathieson casually sitting on his sofa in the living room before he led them upstairs. Describing the horror that then met them, prosecutor Jane Farquharson said: 'Mathieson went into the bedroom first. 'He put on the light and hung back at the door whilst the women walked in. 'As soon as they entered the bedroom, they saw the deceased, lying on her back and on top of the double bed.' Mathieson then grabbed two knives from a set of drawers before blocking the door. One of the women begged Mathieson to let them go but he grabbed their mobile phones and flung them away, the court heard. He initially tormented them by stroking them with the knives before threatening to kill them if they did not follow his demands. Miss Farquharson: 'He told both to remove their clothing and to dance for him. 'In fear of what he might do and, with the body of the deceased lying on the bed in front of them, each did as they were told.' Mathieson went on to rape the pair, aged 26 and 22 - including attacking one after ordering her to lie beside Ms Maurer's dead body. The pair were trapped in the bedroom for 10 minutes before he ordered them downstairs. Once there, Mathieson continued to humiliate them before raping them again. Miss Farquharson said: 'Over the course of the assault in the living room, he told them that his son was asleep in the bedroom upstairs. 'He appeared to have an awareness of what he had done advising both: 'I'm going to be many years in prison because I killed that girl. 'I've done this to show my wife something.' Mathieson then went to a window thinking his partner had returned and, sensing an opportunity to escape, the women ran for the door. Mathieson tried to chase them, striking one on the leg with a knife, but they managed to escape and ran to a nearby flat where a woman came to their aid. Miss Farquharson: 'Both repeatedly stated their thanks and asked for help. They were crying and appeared to be terrified.' After the women escaped, Mathieson dialled 999 himself and told the operator: 'I've been high on drugs and I've killed a prostitute. 'Tell the officers I am not aggressive. I'm sitting on the couch. I had two other girls, but I've let them go.' Mathieson was still sitting in his living room when police turned up. He got down on his knees and held out his hands when officers arrested him. Mathieson, a car sales manager, carried out the horrific crimes at his home in Falkirk, Stirlingshire (above), while his partner went on a work night out. He is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder and rape . His partner, clueless as to what had happened in her absence, arrived back at the family property at about 2am. She was described as being 'hysterical' upon learning what had happened. Mathieson, a sales manager, was remanded in custody at the hearing today and will return to the dock next month. His court appearance was briefly interrupted today after he began crying hysterically and loudly retching as if he was going to be sick. In what is rarely seen in court, his QC Donald Findlay left his own seat to sit beside Mathieson in the dock and speak to him briefly before the case continued. The court was given no reason for what caused him to carry out the horrific murder and rapes, but it is believed his drug problem may have been a factor. In the spring of last year, he had started attending Cocaine Anonymous having built up a large debt. His girlfriend was not aware of the drug habit until finding out about the cash he owed, the court heard. Mr Findlay, defending, said that before his crimes Mathieson had been of 'impeccable character', but said he now accepted 'full responsibility' for his actions. Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentencing until May 7. Speaking after the hearing, detective inspector Dave Pinkney, from Police Scotland, said: 'The incidents that took place within the property in Springfield Drive led to the death of one woman and left two other females traumatised and extremely distressed having been the victims of serious sexual assaults. 'Police responded quickly to the area and detained Mathieson almost immediately. 'Following extensive forensic enquiries he was ultimately charged in connection with all of the reported offences. 'I would like to thank the victims and the family of Luciana Maurer for their courage and assistance during the course of this investigation. 'While nothing can undo the pain Steven Mathieson's actions have caused, they can take some solace in his conviction as we await his sentence.'\n",

            "Four tries and a total of 30 points from goalkicking winger Josh Mantellato broke brave Bradford's hearts as Hull KR avoided a potential Ladbrokes Challenge Cup banana skin with a 50-30 victory at the Odsal Stadium. Rovers twice came came from behind, trailing 12-0 in the early stages to the Kingstone Press Championship heavyweights, before easing clear with five tries in the final 18 minutes. Amid a pulsating and sometimes controversial cup tie, the hosts ultimately had no answer to Italian international Mantellato, whose last three tries came within the space of seven decisive minutes. It was only the East Yorkshire side's second cup tie success since reaching the quarter-finals in 2011 and their first Challenge Cup victory at Bradford since 1926, albeit only the third time the clubs had met in the competition since then. Winger Josh Mantellato scored four tries and kicked 14 points for Hull KR against Bradford Bulls . Having forced several errors from the Super League side in the opening exchanges, it took a fired-up Bulls less than six minutes to go ahead as Adam O'Brien barged his way through and under the posts. Ryan Shaw converted on his way to a tally of five goals. The Bulls struck again when O'Brien and Etu Uaisele put Dale Ferguson over, although Shaw got a fortuitous bounce off the upright in adding the extras this time. Rovers bounced back, capitalising on an unforced error from Shaw to halve the early deficit when winger Mantellato dived over in the corner then converted his own try. Rovers lost forward Greg Burke to a clash of heads midway through the half but they levelled when an Albert Kelly cross-field kick was tapped back by Mantellato for Kris Welham to touchdown with Mantellato again stroking over the extras. A scintillating weaving solo run by Kelly gave the visitors the led for the first time and Mantellato's conversion sent the Robins in at half time with an 18-12 advantage. A minute before the interval the temperature was cranked up a notch when, out of the blue, Rovers Adam Walker launched a blatant punch at O'Brien and was sin-binned, along with the Bulls Adam Sidlow, who also gained a yellow card after following in with his version of justice. Less than a minute into the second half the Bulls gave notice that they were not finished when Danny Addy completed a stirring break from Alex Mellor to score and Shaw levelled matters. The home joy was short-lived as Kieran Dixon broke clear, only to be stopped by a superb tackle from Uaisele, but Graeme Horne then strode through the regrouping defence to edge Rovers in front again. Mantellato's kick bounced back off of the upright and Bradford nearly responded when Uaisele crossed but the final pass was deemed forward. Sidlow and Addy went close and O'Brien was held up before the home crowd were up in arms again as Kevin Larroyer stole the ball from Addy in what looked to many like a two-man tackle and ran unopposed over 25 metres to score a controversial try. Still the Bulls were not finished as O'Brien put Lee Gaskell in for his 11th try of the season and Shaw closed the gap to just four points again. Three minutes later Lucas Walshaw crashed over after innovative work from Paul Clough, Addy and Gaskell and Shaw edged Bradford back in front. But three tries, all from Mantellato, in seven minutes finally quashed the brave Bulls' hopes of an upset. Controversy reined once more as Mantellato gave Rovers the lead again, amid vociferous calls for a forward pass, but there was no doubt when the Italian international raced away for his hat-trick after Shaw fatally allowed a bomb-kick to bounce. Mantellato struck once more before John Boudebza helped raise the half century for Rovers on the hooter.\n",

'Instead of the open spaces that have been described to them, they landed here with steep hills rising in front of this narrow beach,' he said. He said the opposing forces who set upon one another with such devastating results had something in common - they believed what they were doing was right and necessary, and both sides conducted themselves with courage and bravery. 'The campaign waged here ensured that the name of this place would be written into the histories of New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Turkey and the many other countries that fought here, never to be erased,' he said.

            "The baggage handler who woke up from a nap inside the cargo hold of a flying plane did not realize until a piece of luggage fell on top of him. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 bound for Los Angeles was forced to return to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Monday when passengers heard banging and pleas for help coming from beneath the aircraft. Today, the unnamed Seattle Airport employee revealed he might have slept much longer if it hadn't been for the passengers' bags. He told ABC News: 'When the bags started moving and I heard the sound of the engine, I had to think fast about what to do for me to get out.' Scroll down for audio and video . Can you hear me now? This is the moment an Alaska Airlines baggage handler was pulled from the cargo hold after falling asleep. Earlier, the terrified man called 911 begging the dispatcher for help . Safe: This is the baggage handler who fell asleep aboard the Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Los Angeles on Monday . In a desperate bid for help, he called 911 and spoke to a bemused operator for 44 seconds before he was cut off. 'It was nothing but pitch black and a loud noise,' the man told ABC. 'So I was scared, and I didn't know what was going on.' The employee of airline contractor Menzies Aviation had dozed off inside the plane at the end of his shift and woke 14 minutes into the flight. On Thursday, the trapped baggage handler's desperate 911 call was released, revealing the man's panic and terror. 'Hello, I'm trapped in this plane!' he tells he operator. The woman ostensibly struggles to grasp what's happening and asks for an explanation. 'You're where?' the dispatcher asks. 'I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's moving in the air,' he replies. The airport worker then rattles off the number of the flight and begs the dispatcher to call for help. 'Can you please, can somebody stop it?' he pleads. The man grows increasingly exasperated on the call, telling the woman on the other end of the line that he is not at the airport, but rather inside a flying plane. As he struggles to lay out his situation, the phone begins to cut out and eventually the call gets disconnected . The operator made an attempt to call the man back, but his phone was no longer in service. A passenger on board Flight 448 recorded video of the baggage handlder's knocking that passengers could hear inside the cabin . Emergency landing: The pilot turned back to Seattle 14 minutes into the flight when he heard screaming . Luckily for the drowsy airport staffer, he had better luck with passengers aboard Flight 448 who heard his banging and screams and alerted the crew. 'Help! Help! Help!' the man screamed, according to one traveler. The airline said in a news release the captain immediately returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and declared an emergency for priority landing. The cargo hold where the handler was trapped is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was not in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. 'At some point the marshal kind of made himself known and started banging back and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something,'' Troi Ge, a passenger on board the flight, told NBC News. Mr Ge, a sound designer from Burbank, recorded video aboard the plane in which passengers could hear the banging from the cargo hold. After the plane landed, a ramp agent was found inside the front cargo hold. Video taken by KIRO 7 showed the worker calmly walking out of the cargo hold and putting on a high visibility jacket. He stood talking to airport staff for a few seconds before walking off towards the terminal. 'Upon exiting, he told authorities he had fallen asleep,' the airline said. The worker, an employee of Menzies Aviation, walked off the plane and appeared well, but was taken to a hospital as a precaution. He was released home after passing a drug test. The worker, who was part of a four-person crew, started his shift at 5am Monday morning and was scheduled to finish work at 2.30pm, according to the airline. After the team was done loading all the luggage onto the plane, the leader of the crew noticed that one of his staffers was nowhere to be found. He tried calling and texting him but the man did not respond, leading his supervisor to believe that he had gone home at the end of the shift, reported KOMO News. The airline says it is investigating the situation. The pilot could hear banging and screaming from beneath the aircraft as they flew from Seattle to LA . The man appeared to be well as he walked around the runway talking to airport employees . Alaska Airlines is investigating how the man managed to fall asleep before the LA-bound flight took off . Passenger Marty Collins told KOMO-TV in Seattle the flight was surrounded by emergency vehicles when it returned to the airport. She said passengers did not hear the worker banging or making noise. 'Nobody on the plane heard anything like that, nobody knew why we were turning around,' she told the station. 'They just said we were fine and we weren't in any danger. Passenger Troi Ge told the station Q13Fox that at one point a federal air marshal revealed himself and started banging back. He then yelled to the man in the cargo hold that the plane was about to land and urged him to hold onto something to prevent injury. The flight departed again at 3.52pm and was expected to arrive in Los Angeles at 6.27pm, about 80 minutes late, according to the airline's website.\n",

            "With luxury plane suites pushing the boundaries of lavish travel, the upstairs-downstairs-style divide between economy and suites is continually growing. And now Airbus is set to introduce an extra seat to each row of its Airbus A380 model, squeezing yet more passengers onto each plane. From 2017 there will be 11 seats incorporated into the same space as the current 10 are placed, and  a fourth class introduced in response to the new dreaded middle seat. Scroll down for video . Tight squeeze! Airbus are set to cram an extra seat into their Airbus 380 in the middle section. The change is due to come into place in 2017 . The configuration was rejected by Emirates but two manufacturers, Zodiac and Geven, have agreed to deliver the seats . The addition of the centre seat will change the current configuration from 3-4-3 to become a 3-5-3 set up. At the moment the company uses First, Business and Economy class, but there will soon be the addition of 'budget economy', cleverly branded as Choice Economy. Some critics have gone as far as calling the new set-up 'economy minus'. Senior Vice President of Marketing for Airbus Christopher Emerson, told trade publication Leeham News and Comment: 'Ninety per cent of world travellers are economy but not all are homogeneous. 'We want to give a choice to the 90 per cent of the economy passengers. They are going to be the driver of the growth, the doubling of growth in the next 15 years.' Miraculously the inclusion of an additional seat will not alter the seat width for economy ticket holders. Currently the width is 18in, which falls in line with the aircraft manufacturer's manifesto 18 months ago to adopt that size as an industry standard. Airbus claims a rearrange of the cabin has enabled it to maintain this width and squeeze in the extra seat. The width of the arm rest, however, will change, with the aircraft adopting a slimmer version. The launch was announced in Hamburg this week, despite customer Emirates Airlines confirming it would not pursue the new arrangement for its aircraft - reportedly over fears the new design could affect its reputation for quality economy seating, according to trade publication Aviation Week. Airbus Vice President-Cabin Innovation and Design Ingo Wuggetzer said at the Aircraft Interiors Expo that more innovation should be going into economy cabins. 'In the past most innovation went into premium products, but that is only for six per cent of the travellers,' he said. The Airbus A380 will be advertised as having 544 seats instead of 525, and Emerson said the additional revenue per aircraft would be $20m per year. 'That's the equivalent of 40 per cent fuel burn reduction,' he explained. How the other half live! Rich fliers can enjoy private three-room suite for a luxurious first-class experience . Luxury surroundings: The Airbus 380 cabin is one of the quietest and most spacious in the sky .\n",

            "This felt a heavy blow for Derby County. Looking on course for a first victory in seven Championship games against the 10 men of Watford, they conceded an equaliser to Odion Ighalo that further undermines their promotion ambitions. Adlene Guedioura seized on hesitant defending by Craig Forsyth with 15 minutes to go to slip a weighted pass to his Watford team-mate, who poked the ball past Lee Grant to snatch an unlikely point. There was a seismic rally from the hosts, who ended the game camped in Watford’s box, never mind half. The final act was Heurelho Gomes producing a fingertip save from Richard Keogh’s header.

Only on goal difference however. Having played a man up for the entire second half, this was a big opportunity missed. It had seemed Tom Ince, fresh from pulling out of England’s Under-21 side to concentrate on reigniting his stuttering career, had produced a goal of splendour that would do much the same for Derby’s season. Ince picked up the ball in the 57th minute, danced round two Watford defenders and bent a finish into the far corner. At that stage Derby were set for a first victory since February 24. But Slavisa Jokanovic adjusted his team cleverly and Watford found a way through. Derby had begun the match as if the international break had been spent on a leash now removed. A fortnight to stew on poor form and a loosening grip on promotion ambition, here was an chance to illustrate there is life in the old dog yet.

Steve McClaren screams from the touchline as his Derby side look to strengthen their promotion charge . Just two points collected in six games and the for those around them earlier in the day meant Derby entered the contest outside the top six for the first time since September 27. Watford came into this game with a defeat ringing in their ears too, a 1-0 home reverse to Ipswich, but in pretty decent nick in general: five wins from the six before that. The atmosphere carried the appropriate edge for a match of this magnitude, both sets of fans vocal. It was the hosts who started with greater energy. Watford's Marco Motta saw red just before half-time when he brought down Johnny Russell in the  area . Bent slotted the penalty past Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal to level the scores at 1-1 . The former England striker's penalty levelled the score at 1-1 just before the half-time break . In the 15th minute Bent had a close-range shot deflected wide and from the resulting corner a smart routine, involving Craig Bryson and George Thorne, saw Tom Ince released to the byline. His cutback found Bent but the striker’s former Tottenham colleague Heurelho Gomes saved the finish superbly. Watford, starting with three forwards in Troy Deeney, Matej Vydra and Ighalo who have 48 Championship goals between them this season, carried a sizeable offensive threat. In the 23rd minute they went ahead. It was more sloppy defending from Derby, who have suffered from slackness at the back during their downturn. Cyrus Christie was twice at fault, first losing possession to Vydra when trying to dribble clear then driving his attempted clearance in the box straight into Ighalo. The ball popped to Vydra who lashed home a first-time finish for his fifth goal in seven games. Matej Vydra celebrates his goal - the first of the match - to put Watford in the lead away from home . Vydra (left) smiles to the crowd after putting Watford 1-0 up with his fifth goal in seven matches . Late in the game, there was a brutal clash of heads between Adlene Guedioura (left) and Ryan Shotton . Both players were sent flying and needed extensive treatment from their respective physios . Guedioura was impressive for Watford, and was named man of the match by Sky shortly after his injury . McClaren came down from his position in the stands unusually early to bark instructions and rearrange his side with George Thorne needing to come off injured on his return from a spell out. Jeff Hendrick was sent on and contributed to the equaliser, delivering a smart backheel that gave Ince space to thread a pass to Johnny Russell in the area. He took a touch and was brought down by Marco Motta. Referee Kevin Friend pointed to the spot and, after consideration, produced the red card for denial of a goalscoring opportunity. This was welcome change for Derby fans who had seen their side suffer defeat Wolves last time out after a horrible officiating error. Bent stepped up and dispatched the penalty with clinical power, his eighth goal since arriving on loan from Aston Villa. McClaren replaced Christie with Jesse Lingard in a bold attacking move at the interval, in search of a crucial victory. But it was not to be. Bent swivels to shoot at Gomes in the Watford goal, but he puts it wide and misses the chance to score . Bent reacts to his missed chance, while Watford's Ben Watson (right) watches on with relief .

            "A mother whose teenage daughter was tortured to death by her sadistic lover has spoken for the first time of her heartbreak. Margaret Bates, from Mottram, Tameside, said she is still unable to read the autopsy report detailing the 150 injuries her 17-year-old daughter Kelly-Anne suffered at the hands of her violent lover James Smith. Too traumatised to speak about her only daughter's death until now, Mrs Bates, 60, said she is consumed by one thought - that she wished she had killed Smith when she first met him. Margaret and Tommy Bates are speaking about their daughter Kelly-Anne's brutal murder for the first time . Kelly-Anne Bates enjoys time with her friends . Mrs Bates, who has two sons, Andrew, 39, and Paul, 33, said: 'I know I shouldn’t say this, but I wish I’d killed him the first time I saw him. That way Kelly would still be alive.' Over three barbaric weeks, Smith burnt Kelly-Anne with an iron, scalded her with boiling water and even gouged out her eyes. Smith also tied her to a radiator by her hair, broke her arm and knees and stabbed her all over her body with knives, forks and scissors, causing 150 separate injuries before beating her with a shower head and drowning her in the bath. Throughout the horrific onslaught, the terrified teenager was alive, begging for mercy. Smith, who was then 49, got life imprisonment and must serve a minimum of 25 years for his horrific crimes. Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Kelly-Anne's death, but Mrs Bates said even with the passage of time, she and her husband Tommy, 66, are unable to read the post-mortem report which details the injuries their daughter endured. Flashback: Kelly-Anne and her mother Margaret on holiday in Barry Island, Wales . 'Every now and again, I phone the coroner to ask for the post-mortem report but each time I back out. I can't face it - I never will,' she said. Mrs Bates said as a little girl, Kelly-Anne was a tomboy who loved playing football with her friends. She also adored children, and often babysat for neighbours. She said: 'Kelly loved children and wanted to be a teacher. She was soft-hearted and very maternal.' Sadistic killer James Smith . At 14, while babysitting for a friend, Kelly-Anne met James Smith. He began a grooming process which was so secretive that her parents knew nothing about him for two years. When Kelly-Anne was 15, she stayed out over night and her panicked parents called the police. When she finally came home, the following morning, she claimed to have stayed over with a schoolfriend called Rachel. Mrs Bates said: 'I knew she was lying. It wasn't like her, but I'd no idea what was going on. 'Kelly was a good girl. As well as babysitting, she had a job on a market stall at weekends. She played hockey and she was clever at school. She was hard-working and sensible and I could never have dreamed she was being groomed by a monster.' She said Kelly-Anne once arrived home with a black eye and told her parents she had been attacked by a gang of girls in the street. Soon afterwards, Kelly-Anne announced she had a new boyfriend, James Smith, who she said was 32 years old. 'The first time I met him, he swaggered down the stairs and it made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck,' said Mrs Bates. 'He was much older than I expected and this wasn’t the man I wanted for my daughter. I vividly recall seeing our bread knife in the kitchen and wanting to pick it up and stab him in the back. 'It was a bizarre thought - I would never normally think of anything so violent and now I wonder whether it was some sort of sixth sense. 'I’ve thought about that many times.' Kelly-Anne and her brothers Andrew and Paul have some fun on the beach . Margaret Bates said Kelly-Anne was very maternal and here the teenager feeds a baby . Margaret Bates and her only daughter Kelly-Anne as a baby . Mrs Bates called police and social services but because Kelly-Anne was 16 they could not help. She said: 'I didn’t know what do to. She was very strong-minded and she wouldn’t listen to me. And I was worried that, if I fell out with her, it would just push them closer together. 'One night she came home and her face was black and blue. Another time, her hand was bruised. I suspected Smith was hitting her, but Kelly-Anne denied it. 'I rang the police but they said there was nothing they could do without a statement from Kelly.' In November 1995, 17-year-old Kelly-Anne moved in with Smith who lived in Gorton, Manchester. Kelly-Anne gets to grips with crutches after injuring herself as a teenager . She spoke to her parents most weeks on the phone, when Smith was present, but never saw them again. Mrs Bates said: 'In addition to worrying about Kelly-Anne, our youngest son, Paul, was in hospital for weeks and I had a hernia operation too, so our lives were thrown into chaos. 'We even went round to Smith's address to try to persuade her to come home, but he was there all the time. The young Kelly-Anne smiles for the camera . 'On one visit he showed me a hole in his floor boards where he said he'd had a gas leak. 'Just a few weeks later, he kept Kelly prisoner in the hole while he tortured her.' Mrs Bates said she then discovered that Smith was 48 years old - 21 years older than Kelly-Anne. She said she pleaded with Kelly-Anne to leave him, but by now, Smith controlled all their contact. In the weeks before her death, Kelly-Anne endured unimaginable torture while her family - terrified of pushing her even further into Smith’s clutches - waited by the phone. 'In April, I got a Mother's Day card from Kelly in Smith's handwriting and I'd had enough,' she said. 'But I was torn; I didn't want to keep going round there because I thought it was making things worse. 'It haunts me to think if we had gone round there she would be alive today.' Mrs Bates said she contacted the police domestic violence unit and was encouraged to give her daughter its leaflets. Tragically, Mrs Bates was never to see Kelly-Anne again and said she still has the leaflets to this day. On April 16, 1996, Mrs Bates said police arrived to tell them that Kelly-Anne was dead. Kelly-Anne had been starved and had lost more than three stone in weight. Loving tribute: A floral tribute bearing Kelly-Anne's name at her funeral, which took place the day before her 18th birthday . Her body was so badly mutilated that police and pathologists said it was the worst case of abuse they had ever seen. The jury at Smith's trial was offered counselling due to the horrific details of the case. Kelly-Anne was buried the day before her 18th birthday. Smith was jailed for life in November 1997 and during the trial it emerged that he had a horrific history of violence towards women. Mr and Mrs Bates have now set up a local branch of the national support group Support After Murder or Manslaughter (SAMM) for other parents and have found some comfort in helping other families. 'I wish I had killed Smith myself,' added Mrs Bates. 'I want him to die just like Kelly did. Not a day goes by when I don’t think that. 'But he had her in his clutches and I couldn’t save her.' Flowers, cards and messages are piled up on Kelly-Anne's grave .\n",

            "Nick Clegg will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a £5billion flagship offer to undecided voters. At the launch of their manifesto today, the Liberal Democrats will vow to protect the entire education budget in the next parliament ‘from cradle to college’. Unlike Tory and Labour plans, spending would rise per pupil – with an extra 460,000 schoolchildren expected in the next five years – and also in line with inflation from 2018. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg (left) will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a £5billion flagship offer to undecided voters. His wife Miriam is pictured in Marple, Greater Manchester yesterday . It is understood that Mr Clegg will say this is a deal-breaker in any future coalition talks after May 7, in order to win over ‘centre-ground’ Conservative voters worried about funding cuts for schools. Education is a sore point for many who backed the Lib Dems in 2010 on the promise that the party would scrap tuition fees and then saw them trebled to £9,000 per year. But Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now ‘the party of education’ and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today’s manifesto of pledges. The tuition fees pledge was not on the front page in 2010, and the Lib Dem leader said those which were, such as increasing the income tax allowance, he had stuck ‘doggedly, religiously’ to. Protecting the education budget in real terms for children aged two to 19, will cost an additional £5billion a year more than the Conservatives plan to spend, and £2.5billion a year more than Labour. It would kick in from 2018-19, after the deficit has been cleared under Lib Dem plans and be funded by the proceeds of economic growth. Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now ‘the party of education’ and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today’s manifesto of pledges . In a pitch to Tory voters in battleground areas such as the South West, Mr Clegg will say people ‘are right to distrust the Conservatives on education’. ‘Our manifesto has one simple ambition and word at its heart, opportunity’, he said last night. ‘It’s the very old liberal idea that every should be able to live out their life to the full regardless of the circumstances of the circumstances of their birth, of the income of his or her parents or where they come from. ‘Education is the great liberator of people’s potential so we need to make sure we support the education system in the next Parliament. ‘The great challenge is we have more and more young people coming into our education system, so we need to make sure that the money is there to educate every single pupil even as their numbers increase. ‘We are determined to make sure that every child in Britain has a world class education.’ The money would be spent on qualified teachers in every classroom, training more teachers, more classes in small groups or one to one and expanding early years education. Speaking on the campaign trail in Lewes in East Sussex, Mr Clegg said he had noticed voters in seats fought between the Tories and Lib Dems were expressing concern about spending on public services. The Tories have matched Lib Dem plans to offer £8billion a year in extra health spending to meet a request from the head of NHS England. By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail . The Green Party would abolish new road building and increase public spending by a fifth to pay for a vast wish-list of commitments, its manifesto revealed yesterday. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation. Launching the 84-page manifesto in trendy Dalston, East London, she said it amounted to a ‘peaceful political revolution’. Proposed policies include protections for the ‘nomadic lifestyle’, a promise to ‘ensure respect for everyone’, and adopting an approach of ‘defensive defence’ while abolishing the Trident nuclear deterrent. The age of criminal responsibility would be raised from ten to 14, cannabis and other drugs legalised, and there would be an amnesty for illegal immigrants here for three years or more. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation . But questions were raised over whether the hikes in taxes on the richest would raise anything like the billions promised. Even manifesto author Brian Heatley admitted the plans were based on ‘a lot of estimation and judgment’. The proposals would see public spending go up by £177billion a year by the end of the Parliament. A new tax would charge anyone with £3million 2 per cent of their wealth, and top earners would pay 60p in the pound. Corporation tax would go up to 30 per cent from 20 per cent, the fuel duty escalator would be restored and capital gains tax allowances abolished. The party promises to scrap the £15billion major roads spending programme, bring in a ‘Citizen’s Pension’ of £180 a week for single OAPs and £310 for a couple, and hugely increase spending on health, social care and social housing. Foreign aid spending would rise by another £6billion a year, child benefit would double, tuition fees would be abolished and pupils would get organic school dinners. Other policies include a promise to end the use of nuclear and coal power stations and ban fracking. Railways would be renationalised, there would be a ban on fur imports, and cages for rabbits and hens in farming would be outlawed.\n",

            "A British tourist has drowned in a pool in a luxury villa in Spain, just hours after arriving on holiday. Brian Nicol, 32, dived into a swimming pool at a luxury holiday villa in the Costa del Sol, where he was staying with friends, but failed to resurface. His desperate friends dragged Mr Nicol, who was born in Glasgow, out of the water and tried to save him. Brian Nicol, 32 from Glasgow, Scotland, died while staying in a villa in Nueva Andalucia like the one pictured . Police and paramedics arrived shortly after the incident took place around 8.30am on Easter Sunday morning, but Mr Nicol had died. Officers said early evidence suggests his death was a tragic accident, but they will try to establish whether he suffered a blow to the head or a digestion problems which meant he couldn't swim. The group had been on a night out in Marbella after jetting to Spain on Saturday, before returning to the rented villa in Nueva Andalucia to carry on partying around the pool. A post-mortem was due to take place on Monday morning at Malaga's Forensic Medicine Institute. A police spokesman said: 'The incident is still being investigated but all the evidence at this stage is pointing towards the death being the result of a tragic accident.' Mr Nicol is believed to have travelled to Spain with a group of a dozen friends, who rented a villa in the exclusive residential neighbourhood Nueva Andalucia. Mr Nicol is understood to have gone on a night out in Marbella, pictured, in the hours before he died . Sources close to the investigation said they had been told the group had gone out for the evening before returning to the villa to carry on partying around the pool. One said: 'Our understanding is the victim had dived into the pool and swum underwater two or three times during the night without any problem but failed to surface the last time he jumped in. 'Although he appears to have drowned, it's too early at this stage to say why it happened.' Forensic experts are expected to examine whether the dead man suffered a blow to the head or digestion problems which caused stomach cramps and may have led to him drowning. An investigating judge has been put in charge of a routine judicial probe into the incident. A spokesman for paramedics involved in trying to revive Mr Nicol said: 'We received a call at 8.40am on Sunday and found a foreign man lying by the pool when we arrived. Paramedics tried to revive him but could do nothing to save him. 'An investigation into the death is now underway.' The group has only arrived in the Costa del Sol, an area popular with British tourists, for a holiday on Saturday .

            "Kingsholm transformed into the House of Fun on Saturday night as Gloucester beat Exeter to set up a Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. The Cherry and Whites delivered their most complete performance of the campaign to earn a place at the Twickenham Stoop - where they will compete for their first European title since 2006. Victory in the capital would also earn the West Country side a home play-off spot for next season’s Champions Cup – however they would be forced to find an alternative venue for the fixture because of a pre-arranged Madness concert in front of The Shed. Gloucester centre Bill Meakes celebrates after he scored the opening try for his side at Kingsholm . Gloucester lock Mariano Galarza wins a lineout as his pack look to set up another attack . ‘It’s going to be a huge final,’ said Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys. ‘It gives us the opportunity to take something meaningful from the season.’ It was a season-defining night for Gloucester, whose mediocre Aviva Premiership campaign has fizzled out. They played with intent and purpose, establishing a foothold at the scrum to supplement their hard running around the corner. But they were unable to capitalise on early territory, drawing 3-3 after half an hour. Greig Laidlaw had opened the scoring and – to the tune of ‘cheat, cheat, cheat’ after he craftily moved his kicking tee closer to the posts – Henry Slade levelled from 40 metres. Cherry and Whites flanker Sione Kalamafoni is tackled by Chiefs openside Kai Horstmann . Gloucester loose-head Nick Wood managed to get underneath Anglo-Welsh prop Tomas Francis, who was so impressive against Northampton, to establish scrum dominamce. Enjoying territory and possession, Bill Meakes scored off a deft grubber kick from James Hook, with further penalties putting the hosts 13-6 up at half-time. Jack Nowell suffered a nasty gash through his scrum cap – adding to recent debate about the effectiveness of protective headgear – and his side edged back with six more points from Slade’s boot. But Gloucester responded with a short-range try from Tom Savage and another penalty from Laidlaw. Elvis Taione and Jonny May exchanged further tries but – with the game finishing well into Saturday night because of the late kick-off – it was Gloucester who were left to enjoy the party.

            "Two of England’s most ambitious and well-resourced academies go head-to-head on Monday night as Manchester City play Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final. Both teams are packed with talented players eager to make an impression in front of the TV cameras and stake their claim for first-team involvement in the seasons to come. Ahead of the match at City’s Academy Stadium we tell you everything you need to know. Dominic Solanke (second right) scores for Chelsea against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . WHAT’S THE OCCASION? It’s the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final and it’ll take place at City’s 7,200-capacity Academy Stadium, in the shadow of the main Etihad Stadium and part of their £200m Etihad Campus that opened last year. The match kicks off at 7.45pm and will be shown live on ITV4. The second leg takes place next Monday at Stamford Bridge. HOW DID THE TEAMS GET THERE? City started their campaign with a 2-0 win over Oxford United in the third round just before Christmas, with goals from Marcus Wood and Bersant Celina sealing a comfortable win. Jason Wilcox’s team really had their shooting boots on in the fourth round, thrashing Coventry City 8-2. Brandon Barker was the star with three of them, while Thierry Ambrose (2), Pablo Maffeo, Javairo Dilrosun and Denzeil Boadu also cashed in. Man City's Thierry Ambrose (centre) scores his second goal during the 8-2 victory over Coventry . Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . It wasn’t as straightforward in the next round, with a solitary Celina strike beating Stoke City, but City were back to their free-scoring best in beating Crewe Alexandra 6-1 in the last eight. Having fallen behind early on, City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane, Barker (2), Boadu, Celina and Ambrose. That set up a two-legged semi-final with Leicester City and they were very keen to get the job done, winning the home first leg 3-0. Nemane (2) and Boadu continued their scoring form. The second leg at the King Power Stadium was a formality and, having fallen behind to a second-half penalty, two goals in stoppage time from Isaac Buckley and Barker sealed a 5-1 aggregate win. Chelsea started their campaign at the beginning of December and were drawn away to Leeds United. An Izzy Brown penalty and a late second from Dominic Solanke got the Blues Youth Cup defence underway. Huddersfield Town were beaten 6-1 in the fourth round, with England under 18 star Solanke scoring a hat-trick. Tammy Abraham grabbed two and Kasey Palmer rounded off an emphatic win. And Joe Edwards’ team went goal crazy again in the fifth round, beating Swansea 6-0. This time it was Abraham scoring a treble and Solanke adding two. Palmer also got on the scoresheet. A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown, Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James’ Park. That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane. Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback. Izzy Brown (centre) scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month . Goals from Solanke and Brown gave them hope before the break, before two in two minutes from Solanke and Charlie Colkett just after turned the game on its head. A Colkett penalty then put daylight between the teams as Chelsea won a thrilling tie 5-4 on aggregate. YOUTH CUP PEDIGREE . Manchester City have twice lifted the FA Youth Cup - in 1986 and 2008. The last of those saw them defeat Chelsea 3-1 at the Etihad after a 1-1 draw in London. Slovakian Vladimir Weiss was the star performer. He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays, aged 25, for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League. Chelsea have made the competition their own in recent years and this is their fifth final in six seasons. Their wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014 added to earlier successes in 1960 and 1961. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? City coach Jason Wilcox: ‘Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge. We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea. It’s up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I’m convinced once they see us it’s very difficult to walk away from.’ Chelsea coach Joe Edwards: ‘Winning breeds confidence so to have a group of players coming back for this game who were crowned European champions last week [when the Under-19s won the UEFA Youth League] is a massive plus for us. Once you get a taste of winning, you want that feeling again and again.’ PLAYERS TO WATCH . MANCHESTER CITY . Brandon Barker - speedy winger who has been on the books at City’s academy since the age of eight. The Manchester-born teenager made a positive impression with 13 goals for the under 18s last season and has since progressed into Patrick Vieira’s Elite Development Squad. Has scored six time on the Youth Cup run and is an England under 19 international. Brandon Barker is an England Under 19 international and scored 13 goals for City's under 18s last season . Thierry Ambrose - capable of playing anywhere across the forward line, Ambrose was signed from Auxerre’s youth teams in 2013. Impressed in his first season with the under 18s, scoring 22 goals in 32 matches, enough to earn the Parisian a place in the EDS team. Has scored three times during City’s Youth Cup run. Ambrose (centre) scored 22 goals in 32 matches for City's under 18s after signing from Auxerre . Aaron Nemane - another who has scored three times during the Youth Cup run. Right winger Nemane made his debut for the City under 18 side at just 14 and made quite an impact by scoring twice. Has played mainly in the under 18 team but did travel to Croatia with the EDS squad last pre-season. Aaron Nemane (right) made his debut for Manchester City's under 18 side aged just 14 . CHELSEA . Dominic Solanke - enjoying an extraordinary season and hoping to win the Youth Cup for the second successive season having scored two goals in the last five minutes to sink Fulham last year. With 34 goals for Chelsea this season, he inspired them to UEFA Youth League success a week ago having scored in every round. Should he score in the final, he will also have scored in each round of the Youth Cup. England under 18 international. Solanke (left) has been in prolific form for Chelsea both at home and abroad this season . Jay Dasilva - earned rave reviews for his performances in the Youth League, with Ian Wright suggesting he was already better than any left-back in the Premier League. Still only 16, his mature performance have seen him already established in the under 21 team. Jay Dasilva has impressed for Chelsea at left-back and is a regular for the Under 21 team . Charlie Colkett - captain of the side and an important figure in the Chelsea midfield. Will set the tempo and drive the team forward with direct runs and intelligent passes. Very impressive all season, especially on the continental stage. Charle Colkett (right) is captain of Chelsea's youth cup side and has impressed all season .\n",

            "Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish described a 'great moment' as he basked in the glory of his club's 2-1 win over champions Manchester City. After the game, Parish posed for a picture at Selhurst Park with Palace manager Alan Pardew, England boss Roy Hodgson and Bill Wyman - one of the original members of The Rolling Stones and avid Palace fan. Parish posted the picture on Instagram, writing: 'Great moment for me , AP, the England manager, one of the original @RollingStones @bill_wyman.' Writing in his FourFourTwo column broadcaster Geoff Shreeves, who was also in the Palace boardroom after the game, said: '(Bill Wyman) has been an avid supporter for 68 years, having attended his first game aged 10. 'He can name virtually every player in that period, despite having spent 30 of those years in The Rolling Stones. 'Bill Wyman is not only a charming man but also somebody with a genuine passion for the game and its traditions. Wyman (back right) with fellow members of The Rolling Stones back in 1964 . 'Given Bill’s rock-star status, Steve Parish overlooked his normally strict rule that you must wear a shirt and tie in the boardroom.' Hodgson, who was a youth team player for Palace in the 1960s and is from the area, will have been casting his eye over a host of English players. Pardew used seven Englishmen including matchwinner Jason Puncheon, while England No 1 Joe Hart and utility man James Milner both played for City.

But an investigation is now underway amid reports she was set upon by officers on three different occasions after being taken into custody, leaving her face unrecognisable. Pictures appearing to show her ordeal were leaked online and have sparked outrage across Brazil. An official police statement claimed Bolina was attacked by prisoners when she was seen performing a sex act on herself in her cell and that officers were forced to intervene. It added that the injuries were the result of a struggle in which, police claim, she bit an officer on the ear. Pictures appearing to show her ordeal were leaked online and have sparked outrage across Brazil . An investigation is now underway amid reports Veronica Bolina (pictured) was set upon by officers on three different occasions after being taken into custody, leaving her face unrecognisable . Outraged supporters of Veronica Bolina (pictured) have set up campaign groups on the internet demanding the right for LGBT people to be treated fairly . The 25-year-old had previously been arrested over an alleged attack on her 73-year-old neighbour, it has been reported . The photos of her badly swollen eyes and mouth have been widely shared on the internet with outraged supporters setting up campaign groups on the internet demanding the right for LGBT people to be treated fairly. One supporter, Susane Montalvo Sarabia, said: 'It is just sickening that in this day and age such things as this still happen. 'They have pulverised that poor woman's face and are now trying to cover it up. Whether she is innocent, guilty, transgender or straight doesn't matter. 'The police should not be allowed to do this to anyone.' Authorities in Sao Paulo say they are now investigating the matter. A spokesman for the prosecutors office said she had been moved to a detention centre where she has an individual cell until the court case. Brazilian police officers kill on average six people every day according to the Sao Paulo-based Forum on Public Safety. The NGO collated figures between 2009 and 2013 which showed police killed more than 11,000 people. In comparison, police and law enforcement officers in the United States took 30 years to kill 11,000 people. According to a report released by the organisation: 'The empirical evidence shows that Brazilian police make abusive use of lethal force to respond to crime and violence.' However, Brazil is an incredibly violent country with one murder approximately every ten minutes. Many of those killed by Brazilian police are recorded as being shot 'while evading arrest'.\n",

            "(CNN)All Elizabeth Sedway wanted was to leave paradise and head home. But she couldn't. Why? Because, according to her, she has cancer. That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.\n",

            "Julie McKenzie thought scoliosis was the cause of her bad back . Julie McKenzie was assured by her GP that her nagging back pain was down to a mild curvature of the spine. She'd gone to see him three months after suddenly developing back problems and had been referred for X-rays. These revealed that her spine was slightly curved, a condition known as scoliosis. 'My GP said that as far as he was concerned, my pain was the result of the scoliosis and that I should try Pilates to build up my muscle strength'. But Julie, 53, felt there was more to it - she'd always been strong and active until the pain began in the spring of 2013. As she explains: 'I'd been doing a lot of gardening, and noticed my lower back ached afterwards,' she says. 'At first a hot bath would sort it out, but as the months passed I found the aching was bad after strenuous activity, such as DIY, and didn't go away after a bath any more.' Painkillers were of little help. 'If I made a sudden movement, I'd experience a sharp, pinching pain in my lower spine that would take my breath away and force me to stop whatever I was doing.' A month after seeing her GP, and feeling increasingly desperate, Julie, an administrator, who is divorced with two grown-up children, and lives in Bushey, Herts, used her private medical cover to see a spinal surgeon, Robert Lee. The consultant ordered an MRI scan, which showed that she did have some scoliosis and her discs had signs of wear and tear, suggesting arthritis. But crucially the radiographer spotted that Julie's coccyx - the bone at the tail of the spine - was slightly enlarged. It contained a tumour. Cases like Julie's are why some experts feel that too often back pain is written off as something that is to be endured, rather than investigated. 'Eighty per cent of people will experience an episode of severe back pain in their lifetime - but only 8 per cent of these go on to suffer chronic pain,' says Peter Hamlyn, a neurosurgeon at University College Hospital London and the Spine Surgery London. 'Many of these chronic sufferers are simply dismissed as having 'non-specific low back pain'. 'That term needs to be abandoned and early referral for investigation and diagnosis-based treatment should instead become the norm.' Back pain is 'very often under-investigated', adds surgeon Robert Lee, of the Spire Hospital in Bushey. 'This means that treatable conditions such as disc prolapses, osteoporotic fractures, deformity, infection and tumours can be missed.' She sought a second opinion from a private surgeon, who sent her for an MRI scan . He adds: 'Most back pain is the result of muscular strains, and is short-lived.'As long as there are no 'red flag' symptoms - such as numbness around the groin and difficulties passing urine or with your bowels - then painkillers and physiotherapy are good approaches. 'However, an MRI should be offered when back pain goes on for eight weeks or more so that you know what you are dealing with and can treat this accordingly.' For instance, arthritis may be relieved with a simple painkilling spinal injection. If the pain is being caused by a nerve being compressed, treatment may involve surgery. Around 1,000 people a year are diagnosed with tumours - benign or malignant - that start in the spine. In many cases, a growth on the spine will be a benign notochordal tumour. These are made of tissue left over from embyronic cells which help form a baby's spinal cord. By the time a baby is born, these cells should have disappeared - if they remain, and nobody knows why this happens, they can develop into tumours. It's estimated that 14 per cent of people have this kind of benign tumour on their spine and, in most, these are harmless. Much more rarely, spinal tumours are malignant. Sometimes these are secondary to cancer elsewhere in the body, particularly breast, brain or pancreatic cancer. Cancer cells often go to the bones with the greatest blood supply, which includes the spine. These, too, can cause back pain. Less commonly, the problem is a malignant tumour called a chordoma that originates in the spine. Typically, they occur in adults between ages 40 and 70, and often they are detected late - patients live on average just six years after diagnosis. A very observant radiologist spotted a tumour, which was removed . Chordomas can occur anywhere along the spine, and the later symptoms such as back pain, numbness, aching and tingling can be mistaken for more minor strains or disc problems. As they get bigger, they may also cause changes in bowel and bladder function, and weakness of the arms and legs. In up to 40 per cent of patients they spread to the lungs, liver, bones, and skin. Although it was apparent from her MRI that Julie had a tumour, it was impossible to tell if it was cancerous or benign. The only options were to remove the entire coccyx, or leave the tumour and scan every few months to see if it grew. Mr Lee recommended removing it. 'The coccyx isn't a necessary part of our anatomy. In fact, it's simply the remains of a tail from an earlier stage in our evolution,' he says. Julie had her operation in October 2013. Her coccyx was removed, complete with the 2cm tumour inside it. The tumour was sent for testing and was found to be malignant. However, it was surrounded by healthy tissue within the bone, which meant it had not spread. 'I asked Mr Lee to tell me the results over the phone,' Julie recalls. 'I didn't know what to feel as I was in the very strange position of not actually knowing I had cancer until I was cured.' Following the surgery, sitting hurt so much that Julie was off work for six weeks. She now has a three-inch scar, and will need scans every year for five years - 'But after that we would consider her cured,' says Mr Lee. 'If the tumour was found later, the outcome could have been much bleaker.' Ironically, after the operation, Julie still has back pain as a result of her arthritis. But she feels that dealing with the pain is nothing compared with what might have been. 'I'm so pleased I made a fuss instead of leaving things,' she says. brainandspine.org.uk .\n",

            "The U.S. Senate voted on . Thursday to approve Loretta Lynch as President Barack Obama's . next attorney general, ending a five-month deadlock that made . Lynch wait longer for confirmation than the last seven attorneys . general combined. The first black woman to become the top U.S. law enforcement . official, Lynch, 55, was approved by a 56-43 vote. Curiously absent from the final vote was Texas Senator Ted Cruz - a key opponent of Lynch's nomination. He was the only member of the Senate who did not cast a vote. A copy of a Cruz for President invitation later began flying around Twitter that showed the GOP presidential candidate had skipped town early to make an appearance at a fundraiser at the home of former Texas Rangers owner and billionaire Tom Hicks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . IN: The first black woman to become the top U.S. law enforcement official, Lynch, 55, was approved by a 56-43 vote, with 10 Republicans joining with Senate Democrats to approve her . OUT: She is expected to take over as head of the U.S. Justice Department on Monday, replacing Eric Holder . Lynch is expected to take over as head of the U.S. Justice Department on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. The White House said it did not know when exactly Lynch would be sworn in but it wasn't likely to be today. President Barack Obama said in a statement after that the vote that 'America will be better off' having Lynch as its next top cop. 'She will bring to bear her experience as a tough, independent, and well-respected prosecutor on key, bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform,' he said. 'Loretta’s confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law.' Ten . Republicans voted for Lynch, including Senate Majority Leader . Mitch McConnell and expected presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina. Florida's Marco Rubio did not vote in her favor. Cruz tried to block Lynch from clearing a procedural hurdle earlier in the day, giving an impassioned speech on the chamber floor urging his colleagues to oppose her nomination, but was missing when the final tally was taken. 'The Republican majority, if it so chose, could defeat this nomination,' the 2016 Oval Office candidate said said during the debate on whether to take a formal vote on her nomination. 'I would note there are a few voters back home that are asking what exactly is the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority,' he charged. It was not immediately clear why the senator - who had not been shy about his intentions to vote against Lynch - was absent from the floor during the formal vote and a spokeswoman for his 2016 campaign simply told Daily Mail Online that he had a prior commitment in Texas. Like a representative from his Senate office noted on Twitter, the spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said he voted no on cloture, and that's the only one 'that mattered.' 'As you know Sen. Cruz led the charge to oppose her nomination at every turn for the last several months,' she added. Minutes later the Cruz for President invitation began circulating online. The  VIP portion of the event starts at 6 pm central, meaning Cruz needed to leave the East Coast to by mid-afternoon arrive at the party on time. Hicks, who is currently in the process of selling his estate, on the market for $98 million as of last month, is a neighbor of former U.S. President George W. Bush, also a Republican and a former co-owner of the Rangers. MISSING: Ted Cruz was not present for today's final vote on Lynch. He was the only member of the Senate who was absent. A copy of a Cruz for President invitation that later began flying around Twitter indicates the Texas senator skipped town early to make a fundraiser at the home of former Texas Rangers owner and billionaire Tom Hicks . The voting margin reflected many Republicans' disapproval of . Lynch's support for an executive order issued by Obama in . November that was meant to shield millions of undocumented . immigrants from the threat of deportation. Before the vote, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, an . outspoken critic of that action, blasted Lynch. 'We do not have to confirm someone to the highest law . enforcement position in America if that someone is publicly . committed to denigrating Congress, violating law,' he said. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid berated Republicans for . delaying the confirmation and said Lynch was 'as qualified a . candidate' as he'd seen in almost 30 years in the Senate. Lynch has awaited confirmation since November when Obama, a . fellow Harvard Law School graduate, nominated her. After winning November's midterm elections, Republicans asked the Democratic-led Senate not to shove a vote on Lynch down their throats. In a show of good faith, Democrats acquiesced and let the clock run out on their leadership in the Senate. Her nomination was backed by the Senate's Judiciary Committee by a vote of 12-8 on Feb. 26. But her confirmation languished over an impasse in the Republican-led Senate on an unrelated bill meant to protect human trafficking victims. Democrats had balked at an anti-abortion provision included in that bill, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell put a hold on all business until that issue was resolved. A bipartisan agreement was reached earlier this week, and as a result the process to consider Lynch was allowed to move forward. Hicks is currently in the process of selling his estate, on the market for $98 million as of last month. He is a neighbor of former U.S. President George W. Bush, also a Republican and a former co-owner of the Rangers . MYSTERY SOLVED: Minutes after a spokesperson for Cruz told Daily Mail Online that the senator had a prior commitment in Texas that caused him to miss the vote, this Cruz for President invitation began circulating online. The VIP portion of the event begins at 6pm central, meaning Cruz needed to leave the East Coast to by mid-afternoon arrive at the party on time . Despite the delay, she was widely seen as less controversial . than Holder, who often clashed with Republicans. She has said . she aims to smooth relations with Congress. As attorney general, her earliest tests will likely include . handling civil rights cases stemming from deadly altercations . between police and unarmed black men in several U.S. cities. The . Justice Department has said it will look into bringing civil . rights charges over the death of a Baltimore man who died after . sustaining a spinal cord injury while in police custody. Lynch will also inherit major financial cases involving . allegations that some of the world's largest banks helped . clients evade U.S. taxes and manipulated the currency markets. An accomplished career prosecutor, Lynch has twice served as . U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, New York, most recently since 2010. Her office there handled more terrorism prosecutions than most . other offices in the United States. For two years, she also led . a committee that advised the attorney general on policy. At a Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 28, Lynch said that . her top priorities would include fighting terrorist threats and . cyber crime, and improving relations between law enforcement and . minority communities.\n",

            "Chris Gayle is not adverse to bowling spin, so it perhaps unsurprising that the batsman has tried his hands to get something to turn again - albeit if not on a cricket pitch. The 35-year-old is currently in India ahead of this year's IPL tournament which starts on Wednesday. And it appears the destructive batsman is enjoying himself before attempting to help Royal Challengers Bangalore be crowned IPL champions for the first time in their history. Chris Gayle (left) uploaded an Instagram picture behind the DJ decks ahead of the IPL season on Tuesday . Gayle, pictured in 2012, will be hoping to win Royal Challengers Bangalore's first-ever IPL crown this year . Accompanied with the caption: 'Current situation... Believe me, I'm on the work again... #USL #RCB,' Gayle posted a picture via his Instagram account on Tuesday of himself behind some DJ decks. It's not the first time that Gayle has tried his hand musically. Last month the West Indies opener posted 'I'm not leaving' alongside an Instagram video of himself singing along with an amused singer in Sydney after rejecting speculation that he will quit international cricket. Gayle, laughing while attempting to hit the high notes as the singer covers Sam Smith's 'Stay With Me', is no doubt referring to the picturesque Opera Bar on Sydney Harbour at which he was clearly enjoying himself. Despite his off-the-field pleasures, Gayle will be hoping that he and his Bangalore team-mates are signing from the same hymn sheet when they start their IPL campaign. The Challengers travel to the Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday looking to make amends for the past three years where they have missed out on the play-offs altogether. Possessing a potent batting order that includes Gayle, AB de Villers and Virat Kohli - the £1.17million purchase of Dinesh Karthik in addition could see them finally shake off their underachievers tag.

            "Authorities in Texas have banned a seemingly-innocent personalized number plate after three years attached to a swish Lamborghini. Now its Houston owner Safer Hassan has 30 days to get rid of the license plate '370H55V' - after the Texan Department for Motor Vehicles saw it spelled 'A**HOLE' upside-down. The authority has written Mr Hassan a letter explaining that the license plate would be cancelled in a month, writing: 'It has been determined that the personalization is offensive'. The personalized license plate which the Texan Department for Motor Vehicles deemed was 'offensive' Cheeky: The real license plate on the left hand side - but look what it reads when it is turned upside down . Owner Safer Hassan said he plans to appeal the decision by the Texan Department for Motor Vehicles . Mr Hassan told TV news programme KPRC-TV that he disagreed with the judgement. 'I think that the state is overreaching their boundaries', he said, adding he plans to appeal the decision. State departments across the USA have the ability to ban slang or rude words appearing on cars in their region, . In Texas, numerous naughty drivers have tried - and failed - to get illicit sayings put on plates for their vehicles. One driver thought they were so 'bada**' they would tell the world - by applying for this irreverent license plate . A Texan and lover of the female form asked the state department to provide him with this license plate . Those banned include 'I [heart] BOOBS', 'BAD AX' and 'JLOBUT' - presumably a reference to singer and actress Jennifer Lopez's ample behind. More than 120,000 personalized number plates have been issued by the Texan Department for Motor Vehicles, which can last up to 10 years before the driver has to re-apply. Perhaps wishful thinking was behind this idea for a license plate - also rejected by the Texas state department . Jennifer Lopez topped the charts with her song 'Booty', but probably didn't think her bottom would be put on the back side of a car. The application for this license plate was also rejected by the Texas DMV .\n",

            "Quiz question. Which player is the second-highest scorer in the country this season? Stand up and take a bow anyone who came up with Benik Afobe, who was one of Arsenal’s own before they loaned him to MK Dons and sold him to Wolves. Afobe is young, electric-paced and on 28 goals this season - one behind man-of-the-moment Harry Kane of Tottenham and England. Bakary Sako celebrates after scoring Wolves second goal in a 2-1 win at Nottingham Forest on Good Friday . Sako doubled Wolves' advantage from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Forest's Henri Lansbury . Nottingham Forest (4-1-4-1): Darlow 6.5; Mancienne 6.5, Wilson 6, Lascelles 6.5, Lichaj 7; Gardner 6; Burke 7 (Walker, 76), Lansbury 5.5, Osborn 5 (Paterson, 57, 6), Antonio 5.5 (Blackstock, 83); Akpom 6 . Subs not used: Fox, Vaughan, Hobbs, Evtimov . Goal: Blackstock 90+4 . Booked: Gardner, Lascelles . Wolves (4-4-2): Ikeme 6.5; Iorfa 7, Baath 7, Stearman 7.5, Golbourne 7; Sako 7, Price 6.5, McDonald 6.5, Henry 7 (van la Parra, 66, 5); Afobe 8 (Doherty, 83), Dicko 7.5 (Edwards, 66, 5.5) Subs not used: Doyle, Ebanks-Landell, Hause, Kuszczak. Goals: Afobe 46, Sako 72 . Booked: Price . Ref: Andy D’Urso 6 . Man of the match: Afobe . If he keeps this up, Afobe might even be able to inspire Wolves all the way into the Premier League. What a bargain for £2million, too. Having scored 19 times for MK, the 22-year-old striker has nine goals in 15 appearances for Kenny Jackett’s Wanderers. He has a goalscoring knack, beautifully illustrated 30 seconds into the second half when he collected the ball round the centre circle and started running. Back-tracking Forest defenders held off and held off until, boom, Afobe took a pot-shot and Karl Darlow retrieved the ball which had just avoided his finger tips. Suddenly a tight, strangely underwhelming, match, had a breakthrough and Wolves duly capitalised on it as Bakary Sako doubled the lead from the penalty spot. They are building up a head of steam as the Skybet Championship enters the final weeks with one defeat in nine. Jackett has steered his team from the blind side with remarkable efficiency. A trip across to the East Midlands could have been a very tricky encounter considering Forest’s resurgence under Dougie Freeman. The news that owner Fawaz al Hasawi wants Freedman to stay beyond the summer hardly comes as a surprise. More importantly, from the supporters’ point of view, the manager is making all the right noises about triggering his year’s option too. The Freedman effect is tangible at the City Ground, even if this turned out to be the first real blip. Henri Lansbury has been back to something like his best after a forgettable first chunk of the season so this was a step back for him, too. If anything illustrates BP and AP – before and after Stuart Pearce – then it is Lansbury’s match stats. Before Pearce’s sacking Lansbury had 10 yellow cards and five goals to his name. Since then he has picked up one more booking and scored seven times. Admittedly he went into this Midlands derby on the back of a six-match goal drought and it was his clumsy challenge on Sako which had referee Andy D’Urso pointing to the spot. Wolves defender Dominic Iorfa (right) battles for the ball with Forest striker Chuba Akpom . Danny Batth (left) tackles Akpom during their Good Friday encounter at the City ground . Gary Gardner attempts a scissor kick as Forest look to breach the Wolves defence . A bad day at the office, then, for Forest. Maths and time is against them making the top six but beating Wolves would have had the double impact of keeping them in the chasing pack and denting the top-six hopes of Kenny Jackett’s team. Certainly the 27,000 bumper Good Friday crowd who braved the drizzle arrived in hope and expectation because Freedman’s other achievement since his arrival has been a transformation of home results. Five straight victories at the City Ground after a similar winless run had injected optimism. By the final whistle there were resigned expressions on faces again despite a 90th minute consolation from Dexter Blackstock. Yet it had started promisingly. Michail Antonio might have scored in the opening minutes although it would have been a fluke. The Forest attacker blocked Carl Ikeme’s clearance and the ball ballooned up and could have gone anywhere. Benik Afobe celebrates after putting Wolves 1-0 ahead at the City Ground on Good Friday . Afobe (centre) gave the visitors the lead with a right footed shot from outside the box . The Wolves striker (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after putting them ahead in the second half . The home side also had their ‘A’ man and, like Afobe there is an Arsenal connection. Chuba Akpom was on the wanted list of many clubs in January but Forest managed to persuade the Gunners to loan him out to them. He was named from the start but struggled to impose himself. His best moment was a penalty claim when he went down under a challenge from Chris Burke but D’Urso was having none of it. Highlights for Forest included a long-range effort by Michael Mancienne which was pushed wide by Ikeme while Lansbury shot over the bar from the edge of the area. Wolves thought they had scored in the first half when Kevin Wilson’s slip let in Afobe. Darlow saved the shot and Eric Lichaj blocked the follow-up by Nouha Dicko. Next up for the Wanderers is Leeds at home on Easter Monday. Neil Redfearn was an interested spectator on Good Friday and he needs no telling it will be a toughie.\n",

            "A 13-year-old girl has been gunned down by ISIS snipers in the Syrian capital of Damascus as she tried to flee a militant-held area of the city, according to reports. The teenager, identified as Zeynab Daghastani, was shot and killed as she made her way through the southern streets of the Al-Yarmouk Camp towards the nearby neighbourhood of Yalda. Zeynab was shot dead on the evening of April 7 last week according to a worker at the Jafra Foundation, an aid organisation working in the area. Zeynab Daghastani, 13, was reportedly gunned down by ISIS snipers in Al-Yarmouk Camp, on the outskirts of Damascus, as she fled the militants (pictured, Islamic State fighters as they captured the camp ten days ago) According to relief workers in the area, Zeynab was killed on Tuesday as she tried to make her way from Yarmouk to a nearby neighbourhood controlled by the Syrian Army (pictured, ISIS fighters in Yarmouk) The worker, named only as Nina, also revealed that activists and relief workers were also being targeted by ISIS, according to the IBTimes. Nina told the publication that she had got the information from Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis, a Palestinian rebel group who are trying to recapture Yarmouk from ISIS. Thousands of Palestinians have been trying to escape Yarmouk since the area fell under ISIS control on April 4, leaving 200 people dead in seven days, including children who were slaughtered in front of their parents. Around 160,000 Palestinians used to live in Yarmouk, just a few miles from the palace of president Bashar Al-Assad, but many fled after his regime began bombing the neighbourhood in 2012 during the Arab Spring uprisings. The district was soon surrounded and food, water, and electricity supplies were all cut off, with around 18,000 residents still trapped inside. Around 18,000 Palestinians have been under siege in Yarmouk since 2012, before ISIS fighters moved in earlier this month. Since then thousands more have fled, while many who remained have been killed . Those who have managed to escape Yarmouk since ISIS captured it have told of militants playing football in the streets with severed heads, and children killed in front of their families . The plight of those in Yarmouk was brought to international attention in February last year when the United Nations Relief and Works Agency finally managed to bring much-needed aid to the area. Hundreds of civilians were pictured packing the bombed-out streets, desperately trying to get their hands on and food available. It was estimated that, before the UN workers arrived, the average resident of Yarmouk was living on 400 calories a day, less than a quarter of the daily recommended amount. It was reported at the time that some had taken to eating stray cats and dogs in desperation, all while being shelled and bombed by Assad's troops. Their situation became even more dire at the start of this month when ISIS stormed the camp. Around 2,500 people managed to flee before the assault took place, but many were left behind, trapped when ISIS posted snipers in the tallest buildings surrounding the southern neighbourhoods. The plight of those trapped in Yarmouk came to light in February last year when UN aid workers were allowed in after years of siege conditions, and hundreds flooded the streets in search of food . Since ISIS seized control of around 70 per cent of the Yarmouk Camp, tales of their barbarity have leaked out as other Palestinians managed to escape their clutches. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he found Islamic State troops playing football with the severed head of a Palestinian rebel fighter they had executed. The teenager said he stumbled upon the scene after being beaten unconscious by fanatics hunting for his brother, a resistance fighter. When he woke up he walked outside his home and found the gruesome scene taking place. Other residents have also told of the fighters' barbarity. Abdel Fatah, 55, said: 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved.'\n",

            "Defence Minister Kevin Andrews has failed to name the leader of terrorist organisation the Islamic State on the same day the Federal Government announced they would be sending more than 300 Australian troops to Iraq. Australian soldiers are embarking on a two-year mission in Iraq, but will be spending it 'behind the wire' not engaging in combat, Mr Andrews said. But during an embarrassing interview on the ABC's 7.30 program, the Mr Andrews  declined to reveal the brutal regime's leader. Scroll down for video . Defence Minister Kevin Andrew was unable to name the leader of Islamic State on ABC's 7.30 . When host Leigh Sales asked him to name the terror group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Mr Andrews claimed he was unable to do so for 'operational reasons'. 'Can you name the leader of IS?' Sales asked. Mr Andrews replied: 'I'm not going to go into operational matters.' But Sales would not let him off the hook, saying: 'I don't think that's operational, I think it's a matter of public record.' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is leader of notorious terrorist organisation Islamic State, which is wrestling to take power in Syria and Iraq . Sales continued, saying given the U.S. government had a $10 million bounty on his head, she was 'surprised' he couldn't name the terrorist leader. Mr Andrews argued I.S. did not just have one leader because it was made of many groups and there was not just one individual involved. Earlier that day, the Prime Minister announced Australian troops would return to Iraq with the aim to provide Iraqi security forces with the skills and training to defend their country, to degrade and ultimately defeat the forces of Islamic State or Daesh. Mr Andrews said Australian troops would not accompany the Iraqi forces they train into battle. 'No, they stay, to use the expression, inside the wire. They won't be going outside the Taji base. All the training will take place there,' he told ABC television. Mr Andrews was appearing on 7.30 following the Federal Government's announcement 330 troops would be leaving for Iraq . This is a stark contrast with deployments over the past decade when troops conducted sweeping patrols across southern Iraq, occasionally contacting insurgent forces. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced on Tuesday his cabinet had given the go-ahead for deployment of Task Force Taji, 330 Australian and 100 new Zealand troops to train Iraqi soldiers for the next two years. Mr Abbott said Iraq was a dangerous place and the mission was not risk-free. The joint force deployment this week coincides with the centenary of Anzac. Mr Andrews said the mission would be reviewed continually but there would be a formal review after 12 months. He said there had been an improvement with Iraqi forces ousting Daesh from the city of Tikrit. 'So we are confident that there will be more gains over the next year to two and that's what we've made a commitment to,' he said. Mr Andrews said 5,000 Iraqi troops had already been trained by four international training missions.\n",

More than 200 people were found queueing outside the store looking to get their hands on the deals when the ribbon was cut. More than 200 people were found queuing outside the new Aldi store when it officially opened its doors at 8am this morning . To mark opening day, the company gave away golden tickets to the first 100 people through the doors . Ivy and Brian Bacon came all the way from Basford in Nottingham and queued from 10pm last night to get their hands on a 21.5inch television. Ivy Bacon, 20, was delighted to win the top prize. She said: 'It's brilliant, absolutely. It doesn't feel real, we never win anything.' Former Derby County player Craig Ramage, who commentates on his former team's games for BBC Radio Derby, cut the ribbon at the event. He said: 'I think it's perfect. It is easy access and I can't believe how many people turned up this morning.' Built on an area of overgrown land next to a petrol station, the store will create 29 jobs – 12 full-time and 17 part-time – and will have a car park. Permission for the store was granted by Derby City Council in July. Aldi's arrival comes after Tesco pulled the plug on plans to build a large store nearby earlier this year. The company has also made a £250 donation to the council to support its ongoing activities for the community and has donated a range of children's treats and baby products to Alvaston Children's Centre. Some of the company's 'Specialbuys' will be available at the new store for bargain-hunters to get their hands on. It is one of 60 Aldi stores opening across the UK this year.

            "Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat produced a brilliant finish to claim his second European Tour title and break Chinese hearts in the inaugural Shenzhen International on Sunday. Teenager Li Hao-tong looked to have done enough to secure a hugely popular victory on home soil, the 19-year-old emerging from a crowded leaderboard to card a closing 67 to finish 12 under par. That left overnight leader Aphibarnrat two shots behind with two holes to play, only for the 25-year-old to hole from 18 feet for an eagle on the 17th and then miss from 12 feet for what would have been a winning birdie on the last. Kiradech Aphibarnrat poses with the trophy having won his second European Tour title in Shenzhen . The players returned to the 18th for the play-off and Aphibarnrat completed victory in style, hitting his approach to virtually the same place as he had in regulation and this time holing the birdie putt after Li had missed from long range. 'I have been struggling for a year,' said Aphibarnrat, whose previous win came in the Malaysian Open in 2013. 'I lost my coach (Natpasit Chokthanasart, who died in December 2013), I changed my equipment and haven't been on the top of the leaderboard for a while but finally I can do it and it was great. 'I had a chance to win in 72 holes but the putt in the play-off is the best putt I have ever made in my life.' Aphibarnrat can't hold back his emotions, celebrating on the 18th green with his Mother . Aphibarnrat had been six shots clear of the field after 16 holes of the third round, but finished double-bogey, bogey to take a two-shot advantage into the final day. That was wiped out by a fast start from Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, who carded four birdies and one bogey in his first six holes, with Aphibarnrat also dropping shots on the fifth and seventh. Birdies on the ninth and 10th took Aphibarnrat back into the lead as Larrazabal fell away, but bogeys on the 12th and 15th opened the door for Li to take over at the top thanks to birdies on the 11th, 13th and 14th. The 25-year-old was evidently emotional (left), and congratulated by Chinese teenager Li Hao-tong (right) Another birdie on the 17th made Li odds-on favourite to become the first Chinese winner of a European Tour event on home soil, but the 19-year-old could only watch on television as Aphibarnrat conjured up a brilliant finish. 'It's been such a tough day today,' Aphibarnrat added. 'I didn't start well like the other days with three or four birdies, I was one over on the front nine and Pablo was playing great to start. He put a lot of pressure on me. 'I tried to play more safe than the first three rounds because the wind was picking up and it was not easy to make birdies. I just tried to hit it on the greens but I was struggling with my putting, everything was too tight and I felt nervous on the front nine. 'Special thanks to my caddie, he was always pushing me. When we were two behind on the last two holes he said you have not lost, we have not signed the scorecard yet and he was completely right and I just got the job done.' England's Tommy Fleetwood finished a shot outside the play-off after missing from long range for birdie on the 18th in a third consecutive 69, with seven players tied for fourth on 10 under. Aphibarnrat celebrates his second European Tour title having prevailed on a play-off hole on Sunday .

            "Harry Kane hailed an unforgettable week after taking his England bow and becoming the youngest captain in the Premier League this season - but he will want to erase the memory of Tottenham's goalless draw at Burnley. Kane, 21, was chosen as Spurs captain after a week which has also seen him score on his England debut and make his first start for the national team. It was a frustrating end to the week for Kane however as Spurs struggled to make an impact against a hard-working Burnley side who earned a precious point in their battle to avoid relegation. Harry Kane has hailed his trailblazing few days as the ‘best week of my life’ after captaining Tottenham . That came after he scored within seconds of his England debut against Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley . Kane said: 'You could say it has been the best week of my life - to score, to make my first start and score for England, and to be captain today. It has been an unbelievable couple of weeks and one I won't forget for the rest of my career.' Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino admitted a top-four place may be beyond his side as they are seven points off fourth-placed Manchester City - who play Crystal Palace on Monday night - with a vastly inferior goal difference. Pochettino said: 'It is difficult but we have seven games, we will try. It is true that it is not easy. This game was a very tough game and we need to try to win the most points possible in the next seven games. 'The way Burnley play it is difficult, because always there is long balls into the box. They are a very aggressive team and run a lot. It is difficult to find space to play. 'We played better in the second half and we made some chances but it was not enough to score. Three weeks ago Manchester City lost here. It is not an excuse but it is a very, very difficult team.' Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino still believes they can catch Manchester City and finish fourth . The goalless draw at Burnley left Tottenham down in sixth, some seven points adrift of Man City . At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley . Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in their 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Sunday . Pochettino confirmed Kyle Walker, who limped off, has a sprain but said it was 'not a big issue'. Burnley manager Sean Dyche claimed the Clarets had the better of the match and rued a gilt-edged chance missed by Danny Ings, who shot straight at Michel Vorm when it seemed easier to score. He said: 'I think we edged the game, but there was not a lot in it. 'We kept the tempo high and kept pressing high. Danny has had a great chance and it was unlike him not to put it away, he almost hit it too cleanly. 'Having said that we are pleased to get another clean sheet against a top side.' Dyche picked out Ashley Barnes for special praise but said the whole of his team had performed well against a Spurs side boasting four England players. The Burnley boss also said he was not too concerned by their struggles to find the net - they have only scored once in five games. He added: 'I prefer to look at it as two clean sheets in the last three games against some fantastic sides.'

Dyche praised the performance of Ashley Barnes, seen here shooting under pressure from Eric Dier .\n",

            "A leading hospital has slashed cases of a deadly infection that can kill newborn babies – by defying national guidelines to offer all pregnant women a simple screening test. Government officials have repeatedly insisted there is no evidence to support universal screening for Group B Strep, known as GBS. This is despite the fact it is carried by one in four women and infects as many as 400 newborns in the UK every year. One in ten will die. Current guidelines only recommend testing women deemed to be 'at risk'. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bowman, 37, lost her daughter Lily after she contracted GBS during labour and developed meningitis and septicaemia. She was just three days old . But a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at Northwick Park NHS hospital in North-West London resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested and subsequently treated with antibiotics. The only recorded cases during the 12-month programme affected babies of women who had not agreed to be tested. Crucially, clinicians noted that half of the women who tested positive for GBS would not have been classified as 'at risk' under the current guidelines – so their babies would not have been protected. The UK National Screening Committee carried out a review in 2012 in collaboration with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives and NHS England. It concluded that not all women who test positive for GBS will go on to develop the infection or pass it on to their babies, so blanket screening would mean pregnant women would be unnecessarily given antibiotics, which carry their own risks to the foetus. Some studies link antibiotics used in pregnancy and labour to obesity and asthma. In premature babies an increased risk of cerebral palsy has been associated with use of some antibiotics in labour. Yet these results confound the decision, prompting calls for the Government to introduce universal testing for pregnant women during standard ante-natal appointments, as is the case in Germany, France and the US. A programme which offered screening to all expectant women at Northwick Park NHS hospital in North-West London resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested . Jane Plumb, chief executive of the charity Group B Strep Support, said: 'The risk-based strategy has failed to reduce the rate of GBS infection, and these findings contradict the party line that the risks of screening every woman would outweigh the benefits.' The consultant microbiologist who introduced the screening programme at Northwick Park, Dr Guduru Gopal Rao, said: 'There was a substantial burden of infection in our local community which was not being prevented by the national guidelines. 'Our work shows that GBS screening of all expectant mothers can work and is likely to be more effective than the current risk based approach.' Dr Richard Nicholl, consultant neonatal paediatrician at London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, said he had seen more than 100 babies with GBS in 20 years. He said: 'It can lead to serious illness and high mortality rates so it is much better to prevent the infection, rather than attempt to treat it. 'Since we began our comprehensive screening programme, I have not seen a new case in the babies of the mothers we have screened.' The makers of a new style of leggings claim they will reduce the appearance of cellulite in just 30 days, thanks to the garment's 'dimple-destroying' crystal technology. The Crystal Smooth Anti-Cellulite leggings are made from a fibre woven with bio-active crystals, which absorb body heat to stimulate blood flow and lymphatic drainage. GBS is the most common cause of infection in newborn babies in the UK. Harmless when carried by women, it can prove fatal to babies who contract it when passing through the birth canal. Many develop meningitis and septicaemia and, if they survive, can be left with life-altering disabilities. Known as the enhanced culture method, the test simply involves taking a swab from the woman. It would cost the NHS approximately £11 per patient. Belinda Bowman, 37, lost her daughter Lily after she contracted GBS during labour and developed meningitis and septicaemia. She was just three days old. Belinda, who has three older children, had asked a midwife for a GBS test when she went to be induced at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, in May 2013 after noticing some unusual discharge. But she was told it was 'not standard practice' and there was 'no reason' to give her test. Mrs Bowman said: 'What hurts most is that Lily's death was entirely preventable.' Mrs Bowman is now involved in a legal battle with the hospital over claims that staff repeatedly failed to spot how seriously ill Lily was after her birth. She is being represented by law firm Leigh Day. Bond girl Naomie's on a fitness mission . She's the British Bond girl with a body to die for.

            "We're suckers for athletes who play with a lot of heart. In Erik Compton's case, make that plural: hearts. He'll tee off this week at the Masters on his third. The 35-year-old veteran would rather be known for his golf than what he's had to overcome to earn a spot in the field. But Compton isn't shy about sharing his story, either. Erik Compton shares a joke with Jim Furyk during a practice round at Augusta ahead of the Masters . A first heart transplant at 12, then a second in 2008 after a major heart attack - what doctors call a 'widow-maker' - while driving home from a lesson with longtime coach and close pal Charlie DeLucca. He's been trying make up for lost time ever since. 'It's hard, but it's also a great thing,' Compton said on Monday after a practice round at Augusta National. 'There's two sides to me. I'm a competitor and a sports person, and I'm also the recipient of two transplants, and I know what that involves. So when you put them together, it does make a little bit of spaghetti in my mind sometimes you know.' 'I'll take it,' he added a moment later. It's not like Compton had a choice. He recovered from his childhood setback to become the No 1-ranked junior in the United States at 18, then a two-time All-American at Georgia. Compton, 35, is set to make his first appearance at the famous tournament this week . But he's spent most of the intervening years battling on minor league circuits, then becoming an advocate and spokesman for Donate Life, an alliance for national and local groups raising awareness about organ and tissue donation. In a nice bit of serendipity, his first appearance in the Masters coincides with Donate Life Month. But it's already a full-time campaign for Compton - he's been displaying the organization's logo on his shirt sleeve for a while. All of those efforts paid big dividends last year, when he carved out a spot on the PGA Tour and nearly stole the show at the US Open. His runner-up finish at Pinehurst nudged Compton and his story into the spotlight - and earned him an invitation to Augusta. It was something he'd longed to do since watching the tournament on TV as a kid. 'For me, it was a bit difficult to watch so many years and think, I'm never going to play in the Masters, just because of other issues that I've had. But yet, I just love to watch the Masters. So it's going to be weird,' he said to laughter, 'not watching the Masters this year.' Compton's wife, Barbara, and parents Peter and Eli won't be tuning in this year, either, making the drive up from Florida to watch Erik play in person. It's a well-deserved reward to be sure, since all of them had a hand in the push-pull climb toward the top of the golf hill. The veteran has had two heart transplants, but wants to focus on the week ahead, rather than his journey . After walking most his son's practice round, Peter Compton recalled how motivated Erik was, no matter how tough things seemed. Six months after Hurricane Andrew hit the Miami area in 1992, forcing the family out of their home and into temporary housing alongside a golf course near Doral, he took his son to play a few holes. 'We were in a cart and back then, he liked driving more than playing,' Peter recalled. 'But every time we'd leave the tee, he'd drive to his ball, and he was already hitting it 225 (yards) or so. So finally, about the third time it happened, I had to remind him, \"Hey, stop here. Let me play MY tee shots!\" 'He started playing junior tournaments in the area after that and a lot of the fathers would come up and tell me what a terrific story it was,' Peter said. 'But it wasn't long after that Erik started winning those tournaments. ... He could have sat back, said he'd been dealt a bad hand and did nothing. So I think that's what we're most proud of - he refused to give up.' Compton chats with his caddie as he walks the famous course ahead of his first ever round at the Masters . Compton tries to strike a delicate balance between those accomplishments and his aspirations. After a promising 2014 campaign on the big tour, his breakthrough performance at Pinehurst - only the second major he qualified to play. But Compton struggled this year, opening the 2015 season with a tie for 10th. He then wrestled with his driver and missed the cut in his next five tournaments. At the moment, most of his energy and focus are devoted to keeping the ball in play . 'I'm here in the press room at the Masters, and that's a great thing,' he said. 'But I don't look at myself as somebody who is a role model ... I look at myself as a golfer who has used golf as a means to maybe put some of the tough stuff that's happened to me in the past. Golf's been very therapeutic for me over the years. 'As I'm sitting here today,' Compton concluded, 'I view myself as somebody who is going to try to do the best he can to compete in the Masters.'\n",

            "Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson has revealed she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by People magazine on Tuesday. She explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy . 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress. 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health,' Katie Couric wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly. Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Admiration: Singer Josh Groban also sent his best wishes to the actress on Twitter on Tuesday . By her side: Actress Christina Applegate also sent her love to Wilson . Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.\n",

            "Broadcaster Stephen A. Smith has once again taken a controversial stance on domestic violence on ESPN's First Take. Nine months after Smith received a one-week suspension for claiming women can play a role in provoking men into violence, Smith tried to to claim that boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr's career should be looked at separate from his domestic violence history. In the discussion, he told fellow anchor Cari Champion that he understood why she disagreed with his stance because she was a woman and 'should feel that way'. Scroll down for video . ESPN's First Take anchor Stephen A. Smith is under fire for claiming that Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s boxing career should be looked at independently from his domestic violence history . Responding to a 'Good vs. Evil' approach  Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach is taking prior to the boxer's upcoming fight against Mayweather, Smith questioned how Mayweather is being portrayed in the media. When co-host Cari Champion said she had an issue with Mayweather's domestic violence history, Smith said that was because she's a woman and 'should feel that way . Mayweather has been convicted twice for domestic violence, according to the New York Post. 'What makes me uncomfortable is that they're also lumping all of this other stuff that Floyd Mayweather allegedly has done to say, \"Well, you know what? Look at how much of a bad guy he is\",' Smith told Champion and Skip Bayless on April 8. He added: 'When you take the position that you take, Cari, against - I got no problems with this, you're a woman, you should feel that way - anybody else, based on what he's been accused of, I get that. I have no issue whatsoever.' Champion jumped in, saying: 'I definitely have an issue with his domestic-violence record, but I also have an issue with how he treats women period outside the ring.' Smith stuck with his words, claiming that Champion only holds the position she has because she is a woman. He said: 'I'm saying that her position is clear because she's a woman, and this is how she feels he conducts himself. 'I am a boxing fan. When I'm talking about Mayweather-Pacquiao, I'm thinking about two dudes strictly in the boxing ring. And that's all I'm doing. 'But Freddie Roach takes this to another level. Anybody that's rooting for Floyd Mayweather, it's almost like, \"What kind of person are you!\" Floyd Mayweather Jr, left, is set to face off against boxer Manny Pacquiao on Saturday. Pacquiao's trainer has taken a 'good vs evil' approach to the fight, claiming Pacquiao represents good and Mayweather represents evil . 'And when you feed into it by grasping what he says, it's almost like, \"What kind of a person are you!\" I'm a guy that loves boxing.' In a July episode of First Take, Smith victim-blamed when he said women play a role in preventing attacks in the wake of the Ray Rice scandal. During the discussion, Smith alluded to women in abuse cases when he said, 'Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong action... we got to also make sure that you can do your part to do whatever you can do to make, to try to make sure it doesn't happen again.'\n",

            "Famous Italian designers like Fendi, Gucci and Prada may be toted by celebrities such as Rihanna, Kate Moss and Katy Perry, but few are probably aware of the history behind the brands they wear. A new book has now archived the changing face of Italian fashion, from the post-war years to the 21st century. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day, captures the evolution of Mediterranean style through 300 iconic dresses and archived images. Model Joan Olsen (left) shows off bold linear prints in an outfit by haute couture designer/artist Livio de Simone in 1954. Co-author Enrico says that Italian glamour is not 'sophisticated or artificial' The book was compiled by Enrico Quinto and Paolo Tinarelli - the two men who  were the first to introduce the concept of vintage style in Italy . The volume has been compiled by Enrico Quinto, 51, and Paolo Tinarelli, 49. The two men established the first flea market in Rome and were the first to introduce the concept of vintage in Italy. Enrico revealed that they wanted to honour the Italian designers who have helped to make the country a fashion powerhouse. He said: 'The pioneers that have really put Italy on the map of international fashion have been Emilio Pucci in the Fifties, Missoni and Krizia in the Sixties, Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace in the Seventies and Eighties, and Dolce & Gabbana, Prada and Gucci in the Nineties.' Fifties cover girl Ivy Nicholson wears Emilio Pucci in Capri, 1953. The book talks about how the start of many Italian fashion powerhouses started out with a real focus on craftsmanship . The book focuses on the humble beginnings of some of the world's biggest Italian brands and how they rose to cultural significance. It  looks at how designers such as Miuccia Prada, Giorgio Armani and Adele Casagrande, founder of Fendi, have created a legacy within their labels. Many Italian powerhouses started out with a focus on craftsmanship, using work methods and decorative traditions that were passed down through generations. Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers such as Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with a patchwork of ideas and activities . The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. For example, post-war economic development in the Fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers like Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with patchworks of cartoon-like ideas and activities, which subtly influenced buyers. A woman wears a structural suit by Fernandi, at a time when Italian fashion was beginning to break away from Parisian style . In the mid-fifties, Emilio Frederico Schuberth created an outfit which had a removable over-skirt so that the wearer could opt for a straight or flared silhouette . Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. Creative directors such as Emilio Frederico Schuberth began to create structurally innovative creations. Italian Glamour also looks at breakthrough moments for Italian fashion, such as one of the first runway showcases in Florence, which saw the artistic city overtake Paris as the global fashion capital. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. By the mid-Forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones often seen in that period.

Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones . Model Liliana Mongini wears Germana Marucelli in January 1950. Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer - her designs were on several occasions interpreted by Christian Dior . In fact, Parisian fashion soon began to follow the lead of Italian innovators. Germana Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer, and her designs were, on several occasions, interpreted by Frenchman Christian Dior. The book also examines how trends developed over the years and iconic celebrity moments that would cement a designer's fame. One in particular came in 1956, when Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival. Schuberth became known as the 'tailor to the stars', and also catered for the likes of Rita Hayworth and Brigitte Bardot. His students included Valentino Garavani - who continues to be an Italian powerhouse today. Impossibly glamorous: In 1956, Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival . This dress by Emilio Schuberth cemented his position as 'tailor to the stars' Late sixties and early seventies creations from Fendi, including the bag with the signature interlocking Fs (right) Examples of humble beginnings are especially surprisingly when looking at labels such as Fendi - who originally came into existence as a leather and fur shop in Rome. From the mid-Sixties, Karl Lagerfeld was involved in the design of Fendi's logo with the interlocking F letters. Several designers in the book, such as Federico Forquet, are no longer operational, but were important in influencing and shaping the overall movement and progression of Italian fashion. The book also highlights how certain Italian designers, such as Roberto Carpucci, were propelled to fame when clothes were featured in advertorials - eventually appearing in publications such as Vogue. A piece from Italian designer Federico Forquet, in his autumn/winter 1965 collection . Renowned Italian designer, Roberto Carpucci's structural designs featured in Vogue Italia in 1982 . A defining moment for Italian fashion was circa 1994; Elizabeth Hurley stepped out in a Versace safety pin gown that was to become one of the most iconic dresses of all time. From then on, it seemed that Italian fashion was the pinnacle of daring style. Co-author of the book, Enrico Quinto says that Italian glamour is 'in the DNA of an Italian's lifestyle'. He adds: 'Italian glamour is not sophisticated or artificial; it keeps conscious of the female's body, and it works in the same way as the idea of 'Dolce Far Niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an accessible beauty - simple and natural.' Elizabeth Hurley in 1994 (left), pictured with then-beau, Hugh Grant (right) wearing the Versace dress that would go down in fashion history . Liz Hurley's dress (pictured) was a creation from Gianni Versace's spring/summer 1994 collection . In fact, Italian style has made a huge contribution to the fashion industry today, with Milan Fashion Week still a crucial part of the circuit, and with young models such as Kendall Jenner flocking to Milan every year. Popular culture figures such as Rihanna, are also active lovers of the Italian style. Rihanna recently customised a Fendi Baguette bag for a charity auction, along with Sarah Jessica Parker.

Successful models such as Kendall Jenner (pictured) flock to Milan Fashion Week every season to walk in shows such as Dolce & Gabbana (left - Autumn/Winter 2015, right - Spring/Summer 2015). Italian style is very much still crucial to the fashion landscape . In terms of the state of Italian glamour now, Enrico argues that it is a changing landscape, but something that maintains its simplicity. 'Italy has become more global and the melting pot of different nationalities has automatically brought new influences into Italy's lifestyle. 'I believe that  the essence of Italian glamour is based on a certain 'minimalism'. Clothing still has to be practical and adapted to an understated lifestyle.

Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred. First responders arrived to find that the couple had died from multiple traumatic injuries suffered in the crash. Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred . Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

A Melbourne based couple learnt this the hard way after a crowdfunding page they launched received a baffling pledge for over $2 billion. Within an hour, the momentous donation to a kangaroo preservation project launched by ecologists Euan Ritchie and Jen Martin had vanished, and they still haven’t been able to track down the would-be benefactor. Scroll down for video . Euan Ritchie and Jen Martin's crowdfunding page they launched received a baffling pledge for over $2 billion . ‘My initial reaction was shock and disbelief,’ Euan Ritchie told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I was very sceptical but a big part of me wanted to believe it was real.’ The couple decided to make the page after Indigenous tribes from the Northern Territory told them kangaroos from the region were disappearing at an alarming rate. ‘The importance of the mission is absolutely critical. Australia has the highest extinction rate for native mammals, and if we don’t act now we will lose many more.’ The couple launched the crowdfunding page in a bid to track the numbers of kangaroos in the area . In the last 200 years, Australia has lost over 10% of its native mammals, the highest loss of native mammals of any country in the world over that period. The couple launched the crowdfunding page in a bid to track the numbers of kangaroos in the area, and within two days they received the mystifying pledge from someone called Jeffrey Green. ‘I contacted Pozible and started researching online, and within an hour the pledge disappeared. It was very strange and I still don’t understand.’ Mr Ritchie was shocked when the crowdfunding page received a baffling pledge for over $2 billion . Pozible cancelled the payment because it was deemed suspicious, cancelling the account of Jeffrey Green. The website has since attempted to track down the mystery pledger but to no avail. ‘We still have no idea who would pull this prank on us. They even claimed the maximum prize, a $2000 wildlife spotting day in cairns.’ Despite the incident, the couple hope to reach the $15,000 goal.

            "A 12-year-old boy has set a world record after discovering the largest European wasp nest on a property Down Under. Jordan Waddingham scoured through bushland at Karoola, north east of Launceston in Tasmania to unravel  the plague of wasps after his mother Stephanie offered him $20 to locate the nest. Within minutes, the little wasp hunter made a startling discovery when he stumbled across the gigantic two-year-old nest near a creek bank after following a trail of wasps. Scroll down for video . Jordan Waddingham made a startling discovery after finding the world's largest European wasp nest . 'I followed the wasps back to their nest after they'd gone and collected wood from our sheds,' young Jordan told Seven News. Honorary Research Associate at Launceston's Queen Victoria Museum Simon Fearn told ABC it took two days to unearth the nest from the ground and four men to carry it out of the bush. 'A one-year-old nest is the size of a soccer ball, but this nest takes up the best part of a cubic metre,' he said. 'Normally European wasp nests don't survive through winter, but last year's mild, dry winter allowed it to survive into its second year.' The 12-year-old said he followed a trail of wasps when he stumbled across the gigantic 90-kilogram nest . Young Jordan's discovery is currently on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston . The 90-kilogram nest is measured at one metre tall and a circumference of three metres after it was located among a blueberry bush and destroyed overnight when the wasps were dormant. Experts believe it's the largest subterranean European wasp nest ever discovered with up to 100,000 wasps could have been living inside, Seven News reports. The nest will be on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery  in Launceston over the Easter long weekend.\n",

            "Nicola Sturgeon today warned Ed Miliband that time is running out on her offer to help lock the Tories out of power. The SNP leader has said she is prepared to work with Labour to put Mr Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron's Conservatives win more seats. Ms Sturgeon was today swamped with requests for selfies in the wake of her triumph in last week's live TV debate, as polls suggest a surge in support for the SNP will cost Labour a majority on May 7. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon today warned Ed Miliband that time is running out on her offer to help lock the Tories out of power . The SNP is projected to win more than 40 seats in Scotland at the election, potentially leaving them holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories both fall short. Ms Sturgeon has refused to work with the Conservatives under any circumstances, but has held out the possibility of putting Mr Miliband into power. She has suggested a full-blown coalition, with SNP ministers in the Cabinet, is unlikely to be the outcome. But her MPs could vote to prop up a Labour minority administration, raising the prospect of a Scottish-backed government over-ruling the views of a majority in England. Labour leader Ed Miliband is forecast to lose dozens of seats to the SNP after a sharp drop in support in Scotland . However, today Ms Sturgeon made clear he patience is wearing thin, and called on Mr Miliband to respond to her offer. She claimed that every day that passes risks fuelling the impression that Mr Miliband would rather see the Conservatives return to government than work with the SNP. Addressing supporters in Livingston, Ms Sturgeon insisted the SNP is not seeking any UK ministerial posts. But said she will fight for as much power for Scotland as she can get. Her predecessor as First Minister Alex Salmond  has already vowed to hold a Labour minority government to ransom to secure a £180billion debt-fuelled spending spree in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Even if the Tories are the largest party, I have said we will vote to stop the Tory government getting off the ground,' she said. 'I have asked Ed Miliband to confirm that Labour will do likewise. Thus far, Labour hasn't given that commitment. 'I hope to hear him give that commitment before too much more time elapses because as long as he fails to give that commitment he leaves lingering the suspicion that Labour would rather see the Tories get back into power than work with the SNP. 'If that is the case, then people in Scotland, I don't think, will ever forgive the Labour Party.' She added: 'I have said a formal coalition with Labour is unlikely. 'The SNP is not going to Westminster to seek ministerial posts, we're going to Westminster to make Scotland's voice heard and to win more progressive policies for Scotland. 'Now, I've ruled out any kind of arrangement with the Tories, but I have also said to Labour, very directly, if there is an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons, then even if the Tories are the biggest party, if Labour and the SNP work together we can stop a Tory government getting off the ground. 'I repeat that call to Ed Miliband today, and maybe today unlike the previous few days he will answer that. 'If we have an anti-Tory majority, will he work with the SNP rather than allow David Cameron back into Downing Street?' The Scottish First Minister was swamped with requests for selfies as she met residents of Livingston, west Lothian this morning . Ms Sturgeon has refused to work with the Conservatives under any circumstances, but has held out the possibility of putting Mr Miliband into power . The SNP is projected to win more than 40 seats in Scotland at the election, potentially leaving them holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories both fall short . Ms Sturgeon was said to have triumped in last week's live TV debate, as polls suggest a surge in support for the SNP will cost Labour a majority on May 7 . She also outlined changes she said would support childcare and getting parents back to work, including uprating child tax credits and child benefit and a rise in the minimum wage to £8.70. Ms Sturgeon said she still wants Scotland to be independent, but in the meantime 'will push for the maximum devolution to Scotland'. 'If Scotland is to become independent, that will only happen with a vote in a referendum,' she said. 'But poll after poll shows that people in Scotland want significantly more powers in the Scottish Parliament. 'Now, I will not stop campaigning for and wanting Scotland to become independent, but that will only happen in a referendum.' Scottish Liberal Democrat president Sir Malcolm Bruce called on Ms Sturgeon to make clear whether she still supports the reversal of welfare changes made since 2010. He said: 'The SNP need to come clean. Are they planning to reverse welfare changes since 2010? 'This is what they have spent five years telling people. If so, where are they going to find the money that they have said would be £2.5 billion for Scotland alone? 'If they are not, people will expect them to admit that they are not going back to 2010. 'SNP voters will believe they've been led up the garden path. 'Only Liberal Democrats have set out costed and credible plans to balance the books by 2018, building a stronger economy and a fairer society. The SNP are all over the place when it comes to balancing the books.'\n",

            "A Pole with convictions for violence was on his way to Britain from Calais when he snatched a schoolgirl in front of her mother before raping and murdering her, it emerged today. Zbigniew Huminski, 38, has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe, yesterday afternoon in France ‘while drunk’. She was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and after being forced into Huminski’s car and then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the UK. Scroll down for video . On his way to Britain: Zbigniew Huminski (left), 38, has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (right), yesterday afternoon in France ‘while drunk’ Horrifying: The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken . Chloe’s mother, named only as Isabelle, ‘heard her daughter’s screams’ as she was being taken away from outside her school in Calais - but was unable to do anything. Jean Pierre Valensi, the prosecutor of nearby Boulogne-sur-Mer, said Huminski was arrested hours later and ‘immediately recognised his involvement in the murder of the child.’ DNA evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ‘strangulation and sexual violence’, said Mr Valensi. Tests also showed Huminski was over the alcohol limit for driving. Huminski had been banned from French territory after being convicted twice for acts of ‘extreme violence’ including attacking a frail pensioner with a knife. But he had driven to France in a Polish registered car this week, and intended to travel to Britain to stay with family who had emigrated there, said Mr Valensi. Chloe was playing with a friend on Wednesday afternoon when she approached Huminski, who had stopped his car to drink a beer, and squirted him with her water pistol. Remembered: Relatives of Chloe are joined in a march in Calais today following the nine-year-old girl's death . Walking together: The Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart (right) and the mother (centre) of Chloe, identified only as Isabelle, leave Calais city hill with relatives today . The Pole later told French Police that he grabbed her and forced her into his red Seat Toledo before driving her three miles to the nearby Dubrulle Wood. Isabelle, who had left briefly to take her son to a sports match, began screaming the moment she saw the man, described by witnesses as bald and wearing sunglasses, pushing Chloe into his car. The car, which had Polish number plates, was found by police near where Chloe was killed. Isabelle did not even have time to reach Chloe's father so they could launch a formal missing persons appeal before her body was discovered. 'I've begun to understand I will never see Chloe again,' Isabelle told Le Parisien. 'It's tough. Very hard. Above all, I do not know when or how I'm going to tell his little sister and little brother. They are only five and four years old, I do not know if they can understand.' Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his criminal background, and then said he wanted to go and live with his sister in England. Huminski was on his way to Southampton, where his sister lives, French prosecutors confirmed tonight. Flowers: Ms Bouchart (left) comforts Isabelle (right), as relatives and people gather during a march in Calais . Emotional day: A person holds a portrait during a march in Calais in homage to the nine-year-old girl . In 2009 he was lodging in Calais with a Bulgarian immigrant when he attacked a pensioner in her own home, tying her up, before running away with the equivalent of £50 in cash. Psychiatric reports presented in court portrayed Huminiski as a ‘chronic alcoholic’ known for violent burglaries in both France and Britain. He was last convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early on March 27, 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Chloe is said to have pointed a water pistol at Huminski as part of a childish game before he bundled her into the back of his red Seat Toledo at about 3.30pm yesterday, the prosecutor said. The child’s body was found around two hours later, three miles away in the Dubrulle Wood. Sadness: Women place flowers at a playground in the neighbourhood where Chloe was taken yesterday . Distraught: Today people laid flowers at the place where the girl was snatched by the Polish man (pictured) Until a few weeks ago, it was the site of a large immigrant camp, made up of mainly men trying to get aboard ferries sailing to the south coast of England. Such camps are regularly razed by the French authorities, with the migrants moved on. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: ‘I was informed at 4.30pm that a young girl was abducted by a man in a red car as she left school in the Chateaubriand area of Calais, at around 3.30pm. A city security chief found an empty red car registered in Poland in Dubrulle Wood, in the north of the city. ‘He then called the police, who found the body of the girl in the woods. During the same patrol, they found the person who owned the vehicle, apparently a Polish national.’ The mayor has been at the forefront of a campaign to clear out all illegal migrants from her city, saying they are behind all kinds of crimes in the region. Tragic decision: Chloe's mother had let her continue playing in Calais because it was nice outside . Shocking: Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Valensi (pictured) said forensic investigators reported evidence of 'strangulation and sexual violence', and that the Polish man in question had admitted to the killing . The mother of a child who went to school with Chloe told Agence France-Presse: ‘It's horrific. My son knew her, he didn't sleep last night. He knows he will never see her again. I can't even imagine what the parents are going through.’ French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for light to be shed on the suspect's history, saying the family and community were 'deeply shocked' by the murder. 'It is up to the legal system now to carry out the investigation and what we owe to the family is the whole truth,' he said. Calais was plunged into mourning after the killing of the girl described as 'cheerful and full of life'. Residents planned a march in memory of Chloe today. Flags in the town were already being flown at half mast. Huminski will now be kept in custody pending a criminal trial for murder.\n",

            "A new study has shown women still have an increased risk of breast cancer years after stopping taking hormone replacement therapy . Hormone replacement therapy increases a woman's risk of breast cancer up to eight years after she has stopped treatment, scientists have warned. The new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world's largest studies into the effects of HRT - used to ease the effects of menopause. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers. The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher. Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment. After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT  - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time. In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Meanwhile, in the UK  another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment. WHI researchers had intended to follow the women up until 2005, but in 2002 it became clear women taking HRT were suffering higher rates of heart disease. Those women who took the combined HRT, which boosts the body's levels of both female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, have an increased risk of breast cancer up to eight years after treatment . They discovered it was the women taking either the combination HRT or those taking oestrogen-only treatment that were going on to suffer heart problems. As a result, all women were asked to stop taking their treatment - HRT or placebo - immediately. After the reported increased risk in breast cancer for women taking combined HRT, use of the therapy dropped dramatically. The new study, led by Dr Rowan Chlebowski, an oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, and one of the initial investigators on WHI, focused on a woman's risk of breast cancer after stopping HRT treatment. He told Time: 'It looks like hormones have longer term lingering effects. 'For oestrogen and progesterone together, we see an increase in risk - even years after you stop. 'But for oestrogen alone, it looks like the hormone may be more favourable in reducing breast cancer risk than we thought before. 'The oestrogen alone findings are now quite compelling that we may have to call it risk reduction.' In total, researchers examined 27,347 women aged 50 to 79 years old, who had been through the menopause. They had all taken part in two previous WHI studies, having enrolled at 40 centres across the US from 1993 to 1998. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK are the two largest studies into the effects of HRT. Both found strong evidence the treatment increases a woman's risk of breast cancer, pictured, with the latter finding it doubled a woman's risk . In the first two years, after stopping HRT treatment, researchers noted a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in those women who had taken both oestrogen and progesterone. But the study authors noted: 'Subsequently, breast cancer risk increased throughout the intervention phase and became statistically significant.' Even up to five-and-a-half years later, breast cancer risk remained high. In addition, the researchers note that at an eight-year follow-up a 'risk reduction was not observed'. But for those women taking oestrogen only treatment, the risk for invasive breast cancer fell. However, despite the findings, Dr Chlebowski urged caution.

            "Manchester United are to hand trials to MK Dons teenagers Luke Tingey and Kyran Wiltshire. Central defender Tingey, 18, became a hit on YouTube last month when he scored a sensational 40 yard free-kick against Swindon in a 5-3 win for MK Dons Under-18s. Wiltshire, also 18, is a lively centre midfielder who was included in Karl Robinson's first-team squad for friendlies last pre-season. Kyran Wiltshire is pictured in action for MK Dons in their pre-season friendly against a Tottenham XI in 2013 . Their U18 side have been crowned Youth Alliance South Cup champions for this season and face Oldham in the national final on Monday, April 27. United are looking to bring in some talented younger players to boost squad numbers ahead of next season's UEFA U19 Youth League competition. Tingey and Wiltshire are expected to spend a few days at Carrington as coaches assess whether they can prove useful additions to United's squad.\n",

            "Fox News anchor Chris Wallace has issued an apology after 'fat shaming' Kelly Clarkson in a radio interview, saying that he should have spoken of the singer's 'remarkable talent', not her weight. During the interview with conservative talk show host, Mike Gallagher, the 67-year-old was asked: 'Have you seen Kelly Clarkson? You know the singer, Kelly Clarkson? Holy cow, did she blow up.' In reply, he said the 'American Idol' winner has 'a lovely voice', but added that she 'could stay off the deep dish pizza for a while'. Within minutes, Wallace's response had sparked outrage online. Now, the veteran news man has apologized for his 'offensive' remarks - which he made on the nationally-syndicated Mike Gallagher Show on Friday - in a statement obtained by DailyMail.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR 'FAT SHAMING' INTERVIEW . Firestorm: Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace (right), 67, faced wide-spread criticism after fat shaming Kelly Clarkson (left) on Friday, saying the singer and new mom could 'stay off the deep dish pizza for a while' Dealing with it: The same day, Kelly Clarkson told chat show host Ellen DeGeneres that she's had to deal with criticism about her weight since she first hit the spotlighton the first season of American Idol in 2002 . In the statement, Wallace said: 'I sincerely apologize to Kelly Clarkson for my offensive comment. I admire her remarkable talent and that should have been the focus of any discussion about her.' Clarkson, who coincidentally spoke of criticism about her weight on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the same day, is married to talent manager Brandon Blackstock. They have a nine-month-old girl, River. Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, 60-year-old Greta Van Susteren, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Gallagher. 'This \"guy snickering\" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote. Meanwhile, Twitter users condemned Wallace for his 'disgusting' remarks. One wrote: 'Chris Wallace you're disgusting how dare you fat shame a woman who gave birth less than a year ago.' During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Clarkson revealed that since she appeared on 'American Idol' in 2002, she has had to  deal with people being mean about her body shape. On Kelly's side: Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, Greta Van Susteren (above), 60, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Mike Gallagher . Tweet: 'This \"guy snickering\" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote . Mom-and-baby bag: Ellen surprised Kelly, whose daughter River was born in June 2014, with a baby bag that dispenses 'mommy juice' after the singer said she sometimes prefers wine to workouts on Friday's show . 'I was the biggest girl in the show, too. And I wasn’t big, but people would call me big. Because I was the biggest one on Idol and I’ve kind of always gotten that,' she told the  host. Referring to British TV personality, Katie Hopkins, who has tweeted a string of rude comments about her, she added: 'People are like, I’m so sorry that lady in London was so mean to you. 'I’m like, are you serious? Like get in line.' In an interview with Access Hollywood in early March, Hopkins, 40, defended her position on the Heartbeat Song artist, declaring that 'ultimately, Kelly Clarkson is a chunky monkey.' Proud mom: The singer brought along her adorable nine-month-old daughter River and introduced her to the comedienne backstage at The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Happy and successful: Kelly's new album Piece By Piece debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Chart, making it her third number one album . But Clarkson told Ellen she feels bad not for herself but for other woman. 'I think what hurts my feelings... is that I’ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you’re big, I must be so fat to them\", she said. The new mother, who gave birth to her daughter in June 2014, revealed on the popular TV chat show that she takes a philosophical approach to comments about what she looks like. 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' the 32-year-old said. She added: 'I’m such a creative person that I yoyo. So sometimes I’m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don’t and I’m like.. I’d rather have wine.'\n",

            "Unexpected: Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year . Our glorious spring has accelerated the growing season - and supermarket shelves are already bursting with English summer fruit and veg. Usually at this time of year we would still be eating vegetables imported from Spain and South America. But thanks to endless days of sun and temperatures we would not expect until August, English tomatoes and asparagus are already on the shelves, weeks ahead of usual. Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year. It is stocking large Jack Hawkins, aromatic Red Choice and tiny Baby Plums, all grown in greenhouses across England. And the supermarket has been stocking asparagus since the beginning of the month. Strawberries are also already on the shelves - far earlier than normal - and English raspberries saw their earliest ever appearance in the last week of March. Morrisons, meanwhile, yesterday predicted Britain would have best crop of asparagus for nearly a decade. The chain estimates that the asparagus crop could be up 20 per cent this year compared to average, having received an early boost of high light levels and warm temperatures. Morrisons asparagus buyer David Bartle said: ‘Growing conditions look like they are going to be perfect. ‘The good weather will not only affect the amount of asparagus grown but also the quality of the crop. We could have the most exceptional year since 2007.’ Peter Cooke, Waitrose vegetable buyer, said: ‘Our customers can choose from a wide variety of home grown tomatoes and in bigger quantities than this time last year.’ The sunny spell is set to continue until later this week, when the weather will take a turn for the worst. The mercury is set to hit 21C (70F) as the Queen celebrates her 89th birthday today (Tuesday) - making it hotter than Ibiza, Athens and Barcelona. But rain, cloud and cooler temperatures are predicted for the second half of the week. Early arrival:  thanks to endless days of sun and temperatures we would not expect until August, English tomatoes and asparagus are already on the shelves, weeks ahead of usual . Showers could hit the capital this Sunday as tens of thousands of runners take part in the London Marathon. Dan Williams, a spokesman for the Met Office, said most of Britain basked in sunshine yesterday and will continue to enjoy good weather until Wednesday. He said: ‘There has been lots of sunshine around and the temperatures have been pretty decent for this time of year - temperatures have hit 19C in Sussex and 18C in London. But he added: ‘By Thursday a lot more cloud will be around in general and there will be light rain over Scotland. ‘For most it will be a dry day still with some sunny spells, but generally that cloud is the herald of slightly more unsettled weather. ‘The high pressure that has been dominating for the past few days moves over and we see a bit more of what you would expect this time of year.’\n",

            "The Manchester derby is now one of the biggest match-ups in world football. Millions across the globe cram around TV screens to catch a glimpse of the fixture, and its appeal gets ever greater with each passing season. But just how Manchester is the clash between City and United? Sportsmail takes a look at everything local between the two giants. Sergio Aguero and Manchester City travel to Old Trafford to face United on Sunday afternoon . Owners . You will not find many United fans who pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost at Old Trafford. Despite being the man who brought Sir Alex Ferguson to the club and backed him when many wanted him sacked, former chairman Edwards (who was later cautioned after a peeping tom episode in a ladies toilet) remained a figure of distrust. Likewise, there will not be many City supporters who look back fondly on the chaotic era of hometown former TV salesman and combover king Peter Swales, who often came across as out of tune with reality (if you get a chance watch the hilariously belief-defying City! documentary on YouTube), as he went through manager after manager after manager. Peter Swailes was local, but not many Manchester City fans want to be reminded of his chairmanship . Not many United fans pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost . Sheikh Mansour might not be local but is a hugely popular figure at Manchester City after bankrolling the club . Avram (left) and Joel Glazer have proved divisive figures at United since their family bought the club . At Old Trafford, there remains a resentment for those upstairs. That the owners are from Tampa and not Timperley, however, is irrelevant. The Glazer family could be from Timbuktu - their cash-draining tenure is still hard to take even though the yellow and green scarves are not as easy to spot. Across town, however, the sheikh who shook it up for the Blues is a hero. Is there a more popular owner in football? While City fans may no longer (thankfully) pay homage by wearing Arabic robes or waving £20 notes in the air, the man from Abu Dhabi is adored. Managers . It has always been rare to find a football club with a hometown manager. However, you do get the sense that both Louis van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini do their best to familairise themselves with their environment. Van Gaal has taken a lot of local knowledge from Ryan Giggs. More than once the Dutchman has asked the son of Salford (via Cardiff) to speak to the players about the opposition and tell them exactly what victory would mean to the supporters. Giggs, a fierce Red, is said to have come into his own when Liverpool were next up. Louis van Gaal has tried to immerse himself in the local culture after taking over as manager last summer . Van Gaal has leaned on assistant boss Ryan Giggs for tips around the city during his stint in charge . Manuel Pellegrini has been keen to familiarise himself with Manchester over the last two years . Manager Pellegrini with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) over in Abu Dhabi last May . Van Gaal, who originally stationed himself at a city centre hotel, frequented many of the city's finest eating establishments and knows his way around town. While you won't see Pellegrini supping a pint of mild next to the bronze statue of LS Lowry in city centre backstreet boozer Sam's Chop House, the Chilean has also been quick to immerse himself in local culture. Not too long after his arrival he was spotted in a Hale picture shop, having maps of the local area framed for his walls. However, when this reporter once asked him if he had been anywhere nice during his time off the answer of 'York' was not what was expected. Coaches . The aforementioned Giggs, as assistant manager, gives the coaching staff at Old Trafford a homegrown element. Brian Kidd (right, at Crystal Palace on Monday) is Manchester through and through . Kidd is more Mancunian than Happy Mondays dancer Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain . Unless Tyler Blackett makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs . Aside from the local lad, the only things missing from Carrington are a windmill and some tulips with Dutch quintet Frans Hoek, Albert Stuivenberg, Marcel Bout, Jos van Dijk and Max Reckers key players. It is a similar situation at City with Brian Kidd, more Mancunian than Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain, co-assistant manager alongside a number of the boss's trusted lieutenants. Fiery Argentinian Ruben Cousillas splits responsibilities with Kidd while goalkeeping coach Xabier Mancisidor and Jose Cabello, both Spaniards, complete the Latin look. Players . Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United . Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke . Wayne Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. There will be Italians, Argentines, Spaniards, Ivorians and maybe even a Colombian, but unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Van Gaal's line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Fans . Interest in the derby will be spread all over the world. United like to remind us of their 659m global followers while City, according to a recent club-commissioned report, have a fanbase that is rapidly expanding across the planet. Outside Old Trafford, street vendors will attempt to flog half-and-half scarves. Some of the tourists may even buy them. Manchester City fans are derided by their rivals for the amount of 'empty seats' at the Etihad Stadium . Regardless, nowhere will victory be celebrated with as much vigour and defeat taken with as much bitterness as in Manchester. No United fans from Manchester? City fans all from Stockport? Nonsense. Ask any Red or Blue if they fancy going into work on Monday after a derby loss and they will give you the same answer. While City fans may serenade their hosts with 'You're the pride of Singapore' and United supporters respond in kind with jibes about empty seats at 'the council house' both know that this is a city divided by football loyalties.\n",

            "A federal judge has approved a plan to resolve concussion lawsuits brought by more than 5,000 former players that could cost the league $1billion over 65 years. The deal comes after the league has been dogged for years by complaints that it long hid the risks of repeated concussions in order to return players to the field. The NFL expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. The settlement approved on Wednesday by a federal judge in Philadelphia would pay them about $190,000 on average. Senior US District Judge Anita Brody (left) approved the deal on Wednesday after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. Former Philadelphia Eagles fullback Kevin Turner (right) suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease and led the lawsuit against the NFL . The settlement also includes allowing for monetary awards of up to $5million per claimant for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma. Senior U.S. District Judge Anita Brody approved the deal after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. The negotiators did not increase the original $765million plan, but agreed to remove that number as the cap. The deal means the NFL may never have to disclose what it knew when about the risks and treatment of concussions. Players' lawyers have argued that the settlement will help families get needed financial awards or medical testing that might take years if the case went to trial. The league expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (above) has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent players from getting concussions . The league's top lawyer said Brody's approval 'powerfully underscores the fairness and propriety' of the settlement. 'Retirees and their families will be eligible for prompt and substantial benefits and will avoid years of costly litigation that — as Judge Brody's comprehensive opinion makes clear — would have an uncertain prospect of success,' NFL general counsel Jeff Pash said in a statement. The total NFL payouts over 65 years, including interest and $112million sought for lawyer fees, is expected to be more than $1billion. Critics contend the NFL is getting off lightly given annual revenues of about $10billion. However, plaintiffs would have first had to fight their way into court — instead of getting booted to NFL mediation under their players' contracts — to prevail. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually including the family of former New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau (above) Seau (above) committed suicide at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior. An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE . 'From a business point of view, (the NFL has)...avoided what may have been the biggest risk to their continued prosperity,' said Andrew Brandt, director of the sports law program at Villanova University law school. 'Removing this as a threat is extraordinary,' he said. The NFL lawsuits, and similar suits filed later against the NHL, the NCAA and others, has fostered debate, discussion and safety reforms about sports concussions. Yet the NFL games seem to be as wildly popular as ever. 'I know people talk about, it's dangerous, and mothers won't let their sons play football. But I don't see that. I don't see that at all,' Brandt said. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually. They include the family of Junior Seau, the popular Pro Bowler who killed himself at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior. An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The NFL earlier this year said concussions have dropped by 36 per cent after they changed the way players tackle (above David Bruton #30 of the Denver Broncos lies on the ground in pain in 2014) Brody most recently asked for several tweaks, including partial credit for time played in NFL Europe and other developmental leagues, to broaden the settlement. Negotiators quickly agreed to her suggestions. She rejected other complaints raised at a November hearing, including those who say the agreement does not cover future deaths from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed after death, or contemplate the day when it might be diagnosed in the living. Others oppose the award reductions for older men and those who played fewer than five years in the league. 'Although objectors insist that there must be compensation for CTE, the NFL parties were unwilling to settle claims based solely on a (diagnosis) ... rather than on manifest neurocognitive deficits,' the lead negotiators wrote in a March court filing urging Brody to approve the deal. 'Many of the behavioral and mood conditions claimed to be associated with CTE are prevalent within the general public.'\n",

            "Afghanistan's first female pilot to serve in the air force since the fall of the Taliban has been honoured with the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award. Niloofar Rahmani, 23, has defied death threats from the terror group and even members of her own extended family to become the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and the first female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Captain Rahmani and nine other inspirational women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award 2015 at a ceremony last week. Scroll down for video . Captain Niloofar Rahmani, 23, (pictured) is the first female female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 . Last week she and nine other women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award . Captain Rahmani is the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and has received death threats from the Taliban . She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit  pilots. Captain Rahmani said that ever since she was a little girl she had dreamed of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English in order to be able to attend flight school. She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant. She flew her first solo flight in a Cessna 182 and decided she wanted to fly even larger aircraft so she attended advanced flight school and was soon flying the C-208 military cargo aircraft. While women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers Captain Rahmani defied orders when she discovered injured soldiers when she landed during a mission. She flew the injured men to hospital and reported her actions to her superiors who chose not to impose sanctions on her. When her achievements were publicised Captain Rahmani's family received threats from both family members and the Taliban, who disapproved of her ambition and career choices. She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit pilots and immediately applied . She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant . The family has been forced to move several times for safety reasons. But Captain Rahmani is resolute and says she eventually aims to become a flight instructor to inspire other women and in spite of the Taliban's threats says she remains determined to continue her career in the Afghan Air Force and work as frequently as her security situation permits. She is also deeply committed to encouraging other young women to join the cadre of female AAF pilots. 'You can't just see yourself as a woman, but as a human and believe in yourself,' Captain Rahmani told WTKR. 'It was not easy finishing flight school, it was very hard, but someone had to accept the risk so that other women can do what they dream.' At the award ceremony last week First Lady Michelle Obama honored Rahmani's bravery, commitment, and empowerment of women and girls in Afghanistan. Established in 2007, the annual Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award honors women around the globe who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk.

            "(CNN)The bored teenager who gunned down a college baseball player in Oklahoma simply because he and his two friends \"had nothing to do,\" is now a convicted murderer. Chancey Allen Luna was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday for his role in the August 2013 drive-by shooting of Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old college student in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna. A jury recommended Friday that Luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to court records. Because he was under 18 when the crime was committed, he is not eligible for the death penalty. He'll be formally sentenced in June. The vehicle's driver, Michael Jones, pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Jones, who was 17 at the time of the murder, will be eligible for parole starting in 2051, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Prosecutors dropped first-degree murder charges filed against the third suspect, then only 15, after he agreed to testify against Luna and Jones, according to CNN affiliate KSWO. He will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact. Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told Australian radio station 3AW that when police arrested the teens, Jones offered a motive that made clear that Lane, a baseball player on scholarship, was chosen at random. \"We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody.\" After the verdict, Luna appeared to be crying as deputies led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs, whimpering  \"I'm sorry\"  to a reporter. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report .\n",

One of his runs over three miles was when he was second in the Lexus Chase to Synchronised and he went on to win the Gold Cup that season. Irish trainer Robbie Hennessy confirmed Rubi Light is a definite runner in the Grand National . ‘Rubi Light is not as fast as he used to be but his jumping has been fantastic this year and he is in great form.’ The Irish challenge also includes Jim Culloty’s Lord Windermere (Robbie McNamara) and Spring Heeled (Nick Scholfield), Willie Mullins-trained Ballycasey (Ruby Walsh), Mouse Morris’s First Lieutenant (Nina Carberry) and Gordon Elliott’s Cause Of Causes (Paul Carberry). On Saturday Maurice Phelan confirmed Portrait King (Davy Condon) an intended starter while Peter Fahey said Owega Star (Robert Power) also runs. Ruby Walsh riding Mon Parrain clear the last to win  Handicap Steeple Chase at Sandown . Meanwhile, Richie McLernon has been confirmed for the mount on Emma Lavelle’s Court By Surprise while condition jockey Sean Bowen has a chance to pick up the one steeplechase win he still requires to be qualified to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Mon Parrain at Aintree when he rides Virak in the 888sport.com Handicap Chase at Haydock on Sunday afternoon. But Nicholls denied he had deliberately identified the opportunity to put Bowen up. The trainer said: ‘I am not thinking about the Grand National, just that Virak has top weight and I am taking five pounds off. The 2014 Gold Cup winning Lord Windermere has been confirmed as a runner for the Aintree Grand National . The Irish challenge also includes Jim Culloty’s Spring Heeled who will be ridden by Nick Scholfield . ‘He is not over big and we thought it was ideal to claim off him. ‘I also have something that Sean could ride on Monday and we will try to get him the winner he needs but if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.’ Joseph O’Brien, who is battling to reduce his weight so he can continue to ride regularly on the Flat, has his first rides on the level at Cork on Sunday afternoon. He rides East India (9st 6lb) and Hans Holbein (9st 5lb) for his father Aidan. Joseph O’Brien (left) is set to ride for his father at Cork on Sunday afternoon despite struggling with weight .\n",

            "(CNN)Hockey player Jarret Stoll of the L.A. Kings was arrested Friday at the swimming pool of a Las Vegas resort on a drug-possession charge, CNN affiliate KSNV reported, citing a police spokesman. Stoll, 32, was charged with possession of controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy, according to KSNV. He was released from the Clark County Detention Center late Friday on $5,000 bail. The Kings said in a statement, \"We are aware of police reports out of Clark County, Nevada regarding Jarret Stoll. Our organization is concerned and has begun conducting a thorough internal investigation. While we continue to actively gather facts, we are withholding further comment at this time.\" The Canadian player is a center and has been with the Kings since 2008. The Kings, who won the Stanley Cup two of the past three seasons, did not make the NHL playoffs this season. He is reportedly involved with TV personality Erin Andrews, who is a Fox Sports reporter and co-hosts \"Dancing with the Stars.\" CNN contacted the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to confirm details on Stoll's arrest, but according to the dispatcher no information was available until the beginning of the week.\n",

            "Students, parents and staff at a Melbourne high school are horrified after the discovery students have been drinking treated sewage water from a bubbler on campus for more than a year. In a letter sent to all parents during the school holidays, the principal of St Peter’s College in Cranbourne East, Tim Hogan admitted that ‘Class A’ recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain. The bubbler had been dispensing recycled water for 16 months– from December 17 2013 until April 1 2015. ‘The cross-connection came to our attention through the maintenance staff of the College on the 30th of March, 2015,’ Mr Hogan wrote in the letter, issued on April 14. Unfortunately for students, ‘Class A’ recycled water is sewage that has been treated to a standard that’s safe for watering gardens, washing clothes and flushing toilets. Students at Melbourne high school St Peter's College were drinking from a bubbling dispensing recycled water for more than a year . Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium. An investigation has been launched by the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the extent of the possible health impact on the students. The principal assured students, parents and staff that the drinking fountain was shut down on April 1 and is no longer in use. The other 20 bubblers at the school have been tested and none show traces of recycled water. The ongoing investigation will determine the number of students who have drunk from the water foundation since it became contaminated. Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption . ‘The Department has advised that drinking the Class A recycled water may have led to a slightly increased risk of gastro,’ the principal warned. However, preliminary testing of the chemicals present in the drinking water from the bubbler found that ‘the vast majority were at very low concentrations’, meaning the student were unlikely to have been harmed from consuming the water. Daily Mail Australia spoke with a number of parents of St Peter's students. All the parents were unaware of any cases of gastro or anyone who believed they'd been adversely affected by the bubbler. A Health Department official will be on site at the school on Thursday April 16 to respond to concerns the parents may have. ‘If anyone is suffering from a gastrointestinal illness and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, they should seek advice from their GP,’ Mr Hogan advised. Families and staff are being encouraged to contact the Department of Health & Human Services on 1300 761 874. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium .\n",

            "Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone. Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'\n",

            "A 69-year-old mentally impaired man from Connecticut celebrated walking free from jail today after spending more than two decades behind bars for the rape and murder of his wife's grandmother. Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his arms weakly raised in the air.In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, . Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. He later described his release as 'wonderful' and during a press conference he said he'd always dreamed of going home. His attorney said he will stay under a 7pm to 7am curfew with a couple in East Hartford. Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail . One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner. He also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference. Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole. Lapointe's lawyer and supporters said the evidence showed he could not have committed the crimes and his mental disability made him vulnerable to giving a false confession. His case became a cause celebre, receiving widespread publicity as advocates for the mentally disabled and other supporters - including writers Arthur Miller and William Styron - rallied to prove his innocence. Finally, last month the state Supreme Court ruled that Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors failed to disclose notes by a police officer that may have supported an alibi defense. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his weakly arms raised in the air . In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. The decision upheld an earlier ruling by the state Appellate Court, which in 2012 overturned Lapointe's convictions for capital felony murder, sexual assault and other crimes. The court ruled that Lapointe be released or given a new trial. Murder charges have been refiled but the prosecutor, Gail Hardy, said the state needs to review the evidence before deciding whether it can go forward with another trial. Lapointe is due back in court on May 15. On Friday Lapointe, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, shackles and thick glasses, was hunched over and visibly shaking as he sipped from a cup of water in court. His supporters and attorneys say Lapointe could not have committed the crime due to his disabilities. One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner - he also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference . Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole (undated inmate photo above) He suffers from Dandy-Walker syndrome, which affects brain development and causes intellectual and physical impairments. They say Lapointe, who confessed after nearly ten hours of police interrogation, was railroaded under pressure and that he barely understood what was happening to him. Lapointe's release was processed by court officials, and he was freed from custody in the afternoon. The judge rejected a request by prosecutors that Lapointe wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. Defense attorneys say their client cannot drive and is barely able to walk, therefore he does not pose a flight risk. 'We are ecstatic that after all these years Richard is finally being freed. 'This was a travesty of justice from the start,' said Kate Germond, director of Centurion Ministries, a nonprofit organization that works to vindicate people who have been wrongfully convicted. 'He will finally get to sleep in a real bed and breathe some fresh air today for the first time since his unjust incarceration,' she said.\n",

            "Cate McGregor was surprised when she was unconditionally backed by the cricket community and the Australian Army. But it was Tony Abbott's response to her transformation from man to woman that knocked her for six. It took less than an hour for the federal Liberal leader to call Ms McGregor after she forwarded the chapter of her book that outed her. Ms McGregor recalled that very moment - during her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday - when the prime minister told her 'it was okay'. 'I actually said to him \"your party won't be thrilled about this\",' she said, the ABC reports. However the senior military official did not express the same kind of appraisal when it came to Mr Abbott's stance on same-sex marriage, saying she is 'sad' that he is not a supporter of it. Scroll down for video . Cate McGregor - now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force - spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) publicly backed McGregor (right) by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman . Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says. 'There is a kind of a firefighter buried inside the politician still and he tends to barge into burning buildings if his friends are in there.' Mr Abbott publicly backed his friend by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman. Ms McGregor, now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm. In 2012, after years of drowning agonising pain with alcohol and drugs, McGregor stopped 'functioning' as a man and chose to live as a woman. She tried to resign from the office of former Chief of Army David Morrison when her transformation became public. He refused her resignation. 'It was easier to tell David Morrison I was transgendered than I was going to become an air force officer,' she said. 'I love the Army for that.' Mr Abbott sits with Ms McGregor to commentate during the International tour match between the Prime Minister's XI and England at Manuka Oval in Canberra last year . The senior officer addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series . McGregor a senior officer knows she's 'benefited enormously' from male privilege. But she'd willingly sacrifice it all to have lived as a woman from her early 20s. The cricket commentator, columnist and former staffer to Bob Carr, addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series. At times, she became tearful. But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.' The ABC did however report that she said: 'He's not a supporter of gay marriage, I'm sad about that.'\n",

            "(CNN)Twenty years ago, on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a massive truck bomb in front of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  The attack killed 168 men, women and children, injured hundreds more, and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history. The attack's aftermath saw a storm of media coverage with themes such as \"attack on the heartland\" and America's \"lost innocence.\" In fact, the bombing took the country by surprise. It wasn't simply the scale of the tragedy that drew attention, but the fact that the bombing exposed something new: American citizens targeting their own government with a deadliness hitherto unseen. The public became aware of the true danger of the extreme right.  Reports connected McVeigh and his accomplice Terry Nichols to anti-government ideology movements, such as the militia movement, as well as to white supremacist causes. Law enforcement also played catchup. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1994 annual report on terrorism had given short shrift to the extreme right.  Its coverage of domestic terrorism focused on the activities of Puerto Rican radicals and animal rights and environmental extremists. In contrast, the report spent only a paragraph describing the threat from right-wing extremists.  It ignored the rapidly growing militia and sovereign citizen movements, and made no reference to events in Idaho and Texas. In late 1992, at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, a standoff between U.S. Marshals and Randy Weaver's family resulted in the death of a marshal, a young boy and the boy's unarmed mother. And in 1993, federal agents launched an ill-conceived raid on property near Waco, Texas, belonging to the Branch Davidians sect, leading to a bloody shootout and a 51-day standoff, which ended in the death of almost all the Davidians, including a number of children. These incidents infuriated the entire extreme right, which saw them as deliberate attempts by the government to kill American citizens. After Oklahoma City, everything changed. The FBI shifted its priorities, hiring new agents and reassigning staff to work on domestic terrorism cases.  It significantly expanded the number of Joint Terrorism Task Forces and went to Congress with a lengthy \"want\" list. The effort actually paid off.  Increased scrutiny of right-wing extremists resulted in a flurry of arrests for everything from terrorist plots to hate crimes.  Though it had paid a high price to do so, it seemed that the United States had recognized the dangers that right-wing extremists posed. However, just six years after the Oklahoma City bombing, an event occurred that pushed to the background those lessons so dearly won. The September 11, 2001, terror attacks -- attacks of a scale and ferocity that dwarfed even that of the Oklahoma City bombing -- commanded the full attention of the nation.  The government, law enforcement, the news media and the public all rushed to grapple with the issue of Islamic extremism. Unfortunately, rather than expanding national attention to encompass the dangers of both radical Islam and right-wing extremism, the 9/11 attacks simply shifted attention away from the extreme right. Certainly, the 9/11 attacks warranted great attention. They made starkly clear the threat that international radical Islamist groups posed to the United States. Moreover, the surge of right-wing extremism that marked the 1990s had seemingly ebbed. Thus it is no real surprise that concern over right-wing violence faded into the background. The significance of the Oklahoma City bombing, in terms of its service as a warning about right-wing violence, became greatly lessened. This is a lesson that Americans must now recall and recover. Radical Islam, whether abroad or homegrown, represents a serious threat to the safety and security of Americans.  But right-wing extremism did not disappear after September 11. Its history since the Oklahoma City bombing has consisted of a steady stream of plots, conspiracies, terrorist acts, and hate crimes.  It, too, represents a serious threat. In fact, in recent years, violence from the extreme right has again surged—and at levels reminiscent of the dark days of the 1990s. From 1995 through 2000, according to statistics from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, right-wing extremists were responsible for at least 47 different terrorist acts, conspiracies or plots. However, during the past six years, from 2009 through 2014, right-wing extremists in the U.S. were involved in at least 42 actual or attempted terrorist acts. In other words, right-wing violence today is actually at or very close to levels during the days of the Oklahoma City bombing. These statistics illustrate that \"homegrown violent extremism\" is not limited to extremism motivated by radical Islam.  The anger and hate that generated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 is still around in 2015—and still dangerous. The 20th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing provides a new opportunity for us to ensure that its significance does not disappear from the public eye. What the tragedies of 1995 and 2001 together teach is that the United States faces threats from multiple sources of extremism, all of which must be taken seriously. Consequently, Americans must have the wisdom to respond effectively and intelligently to ideological violence stemming from all sources. That would be the most positive way to pay homage to the victims of April 19, 1995.\n",

            "The story of Rapunzel, the girl trapped in a tower who is rescued by a prince climbing up her long locks, has captivated little would-be princesses the world over for centuries. But while most girls grow out of their yearning for tumbling tresses, not everyone ditches the extra-long look when they hit adulthood. As hair extensions soar in popularity on the red carpet, the number of middle-aged women with very long natural hair is on the rise, according to beauty experts. Scroll down for video . From left to right: Fiona Steane is 50 with 3ft long hair,  Sarah Rihal is also 50 and has 3ft 5in of hair, Melanie Brown is 60 and has 4ft long hair and Vanessa Thorpe is 40 with 2ft 10in of hair . And recently, supermodel Twiggy stood up for older women with long locks. ‘It makes me crazy when people say you have to cut your hair short once you hit 50,’ she said. ‘I saw a woman the other day in her late 70s with silver hair down to her waist. I thought, “Good on you, girl.”’ Here, some of Britain’s real-life Rapunzels show off their locks —and explain why they’d never consider going for the chop… . MY HAIR GETS STUCK IN CAR DOORS . Fiona Steane, 50, is an artist . She lives in London with her husband of 20 years, Christopher, 48, a banker, and their 17-year-old daughter, Amelia. Fiona Steane, 50, (pictured) wanted to cut all her hair off when she was 15 but her mother refused and she's had it long ever since then and gets it trimmed twice a year . My mother always kept my hair long. She had very long hair and she liked me to have it that way, too. I was dancing back then, so it was easier to have it long and whip it up into a bun. When I was 15, I wanted to cut it all off and my mother refused — so it’s been this way ever since. I don’t like watching people getting their hair cut and I hate hairdressers. I couldn’t even watch my husband getting his hair cut recently — there’s something about it that makes me feel sick. I get it trimmed, just getting rid of the split ends, twice a year. Then I have a conditioning treatment, which takes up to six hours but feels amazing afterwards. I don’t have a hairdryer. I’ve never used one. I don’t colour my hair. I don’t straighten it. I just shampoo, condition and leave. It’s pure laziness. This might look like it takes a lot of work but in reality I don’t have to do anything. I do make sure I use specialist hair products for long hair. When it comes to conditioner, I slather loads of it on. This keeps it nice and smooth. My cut-off point — when I know it’s got too long — is when I can sit on it. It gets stuck in car doors and it’s always in the way. Fiona (pictured) says she uses special clips from Paris to protect her hair when she wants to put it up . My hair is manageable at this length. When I want to put it up, I use special plastic clips from Paris so as not to damage my hair. An Arab man offered to buy my hair once. I thought it was hysterical. My daughter has beautiful long, thick hair. Hers is darker than mine but it’s stunning. I don’t like it when people touch my hair. I have to remind them that it’s mine. MY LONG LOCKS MAKE ME FEEL FEMININE . Sarah Rihal, 50, is a property manager from South London. She is married to Bob, 58, a pharmacist, and has two children, Alice, 27 and Jasmine, eight. Sarah Rihal, 50, (pictured) says she has had long her all her life and her youngest daughter Jasmine has hair the same length. Sarah says children in the school nursery often call her Rapunzel . I’m not a very girly girl but I’ve had long hair all my life. I went through phases when I was younger where I had shoulder-length hair, but since my late teens it’s been down to my bust. My youngest daughter, Jasmine, has hair the same length as mine. Jasmine has to wear hers plaited for school. When I pick her up, I often hear children in nursery whispering, ‘Look, it’s Rapunzel’ when we walk past. That makes me smile. I go to my hairdresser, Neil Ward, at his specialist salon Long Hair in London four times a year for a trim and conditioning treatment. The first time I went, I had my hair up in a metallic clip and Neil whipped it out and threw it in the bin. At home, I use a special shampoo and conditioner from the George Michael Long Hair range, as well as a cream rinse, which is like a conditioner that you comb through the ends after washing. I keep a jug of it in the bathroom, so I can just dunk the ends in after a shower. Sarah (pictured) uses a special shampoo from the George Michael Long Hair range, but she says there are practical difficulties with having long hair like having to plait it at night to avoid knotting . I wash my hair once a week — it does get greasy but it doesn’t usually need more than that. What I love about hair this length is that you don’t have to do anything with it. I wear it plaited or on top of my head in a bulldog clip. I just wash it and let it dry which takes about two hours. There are practical challenges to having long hair. And, at night, I have to plait it or it would get knotted around my pillow and my poor husband! My hair is my favourite part of myself. It is the one thing that makes me feel really feminine. I don’t think I’ll ever be tempted to cut it. Redheads like me tend to go white, not grey, so hopefully it will still look elegant in years to come. I GET PROPOSALS FROM STRANGERS . Melanie Brown, 60, is a retired teacher. Divorced, she has two grown-up daughters and lives in North London. Melanie Brown, 60, (pictured) says men have always found her hair attractive and that she has been proposed to twice thanks to her long locks . My hair started really growing when I was five years old and I’ve only been to a professional hairdresser twice as far as I can remember. The first time was when I was 15 and my hair was thick and long. The hairdresser cut it to my shoulders and that put me off for years. The second time was when I was in my 20s and I’d got my first teaching job. Headlice are a worry for teachers with long hair, so I marched to a hairdresser in London that specialised in long hair and said: ‘Cut it all off!’ They refused. They said it was so beautiful they wouldn’t dream of cutting it. Men have always found my hair attractive. I’ve had two proposals of marriage just because of my hair. One was from a colleague I’d only been working with for two weeks when he said he loved my hair and wanted to marry me. Not surprisingly, my ex-husband didn’t like the attention it got. Melanie (pictured) says she doesn't do anything special with her hair and washes it about once a week using whichever shampoo is cheapest . I really don’t do anything special to it. I wash it once a week with whatever shampoo is the cheapest on offer at Boots. I don’t use any special styling products, either. I just dry my hair with a hairdryer or, in the colder months when I have the heating on, I lie watching TV next to the radiator. Occasionally, I’ll get annoyed with it. But it’s part of ‘me’ now and I couldn’t imagine having it shorter. IT TAKES FOUR HOURS TO DRY NATURALLY . Vanessa Thorpe, 40, is a production editor. She lives in Essex and is divorced with one son. Vanessa Thorpe, 40, (pictured) will only use hair products that have not been tested on animals and washes and conditions her hair every morning despite the fact it takes four hours to dry naturally . I love having long hair, especially combined with its unusual colour. I don’t understand why some women feel compelled to cut their hair when they reach a certain age. I wash and condition it every morning, as it feels so much nicer. I never stick to one brand or product. I find my hair gets used to certain shampoos and conditioners and then they’re not as effective. I never buy expensive products. The products I’m using this week are Superdrug’s Pro-V, but before that I used Sainsbury’s own-brand. My only rule is that the products are not tested on animals. Vanessa (pictured) says she has never been tempted to go for a big hair cut but she has it trimmed every eight months where she has to stand up while they cut it . Washing it every day takes about ten minutes. Then I squeeze the water out with a towel and comb it through with a Tangle Teezer. It takes four hours to dry naturally, and I don’t use styling products. I’ve never been tempted to go for the chop. I had it hacked to shoulder-length when I was 13, but regretted it. I go for a trim about every eight months, and have to stand up so they can cut it. I don’t keep it this length to attract men, although I guess they like it. My boyfriend likes it, but I’d like to think he’s attracted to me and not just my mane.\n",

            "The Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since the first was published in 1997. And now researchers have discovered its success may lie in the use of words author J.K Rowling chose across the series - rather than the texts as a whole. By scanning the brains of participants as they read passages from the collection, researchers discovered that the common use of 'arousing words' affected parts of the brain concerned with emotion. The Harry Potter books (pictured) have sold more than 450 million copies and its success may lie in the use of words used - rather than the texts as a whole. By scanning the brains of people reading passages from the collection, researchers discovered 'arousing words' affected parts associated with emotion . The emotional potential of words is rated in terms of valence and arousal ratings. Valence refers to how positive or negative a word is, while arousal refers to its 'physiological intensity', or the extent to which it affects the reader and their view of the word or text. These properties are normally used for words in isolation, which can be categorised as negative, neutral, and positive. But the researchers from Lancaster University wanted to see how these classifications and findings for individual words could be applied to passages of text and books as a whole. 'A text is more than a list of words, and the way these words are combined, or the context they are embedded in, clearly matter,' explained the researchers. They screened all seven Harry Potter novels: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (1997), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). Study screened seven Harry Potter novels. Emma Watson (left) as Hermione Granger and Daniel Radcliffe are shown in Prisoner of Azkaban . From this, they selected 120 passages, each of which was four lines long and did not require a high level of familiarity with the books. In each case, the emotional connotations of the passages were at the start and and the emotional contents were unambiguous and consistent throughout the passage. The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages. Following the experiment in the scanner, each participant rated the passages on valence, on a scale of -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive, and arousal, on a scale of 1 for very calming to 5 for very arousing. The sentence: 'And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor', from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban featured a range, or span, of arousal. The researchers said this was due to the contrast between the low arousal of 'silence' and the high arousal of 'chill', which led to the overall lexical arousal of the whole sentence to be moderate. Meanwhile, the passage: 'Ginny glanced round, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry's mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds,' from the Deathly Hallows was rated positive. But its valence was neutral. The emotional impact is said to result from the drift of Harry's mind into the past remembering his relationship with Ginny and the fact the reader has to imagine it, rather than being told about it. And the sentence from the Half-Blood Prince: \"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!\" roared Gaunt, losing control' contains words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal, such as 'disgusting', 'filthy', 'blood', 'traitor', 'roar', and 'losing'. Following the experiment, each participant rated the passages on valence - from -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive - and arousal - scaled from 1 for very calming to 5 very arousing. Examples are shown . The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these passages from the books before asking them to rate each on valence and arousal. A passage involving Ginny (played by Bonnie Right pictured left), and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe right) had a neutral valence . The MRI scans revealed that reading passages like the one from the Half-Blood Prince correlated with brain activity in regions associated with emotion, with building a mental model of a situation and also with the understanding of a character's state of mind. In particular, these emotional passages stimulated the left amygdala of the brain, which processes emotional reactions, and the insula. The more emotionally arousing words a text contained, the more it was judged to be emotionally affecting. But the sentence: 'You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!' from the Half-Blood Prince was said to contain words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal. This stimulated the left amygdala of the brain (left) and the insula (right) which are associated with emotional reactions . Researchers screened all seven Harry Potter novels and selected 120 passages, each of which was four lines long and didn't require a high level of familiarity with the books. The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages before they were asked to rate each for valence and arousal. The sentence: 'And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor', from  the Prisoner of Azkaban featured a range, or span, of arousal.

Thus, the researchers said the emotional engagement readers show is mostly driven by the single emotional words contained in the text, rather than by each passage as a whole. Psychologist Dr Francesca Citron from the university said: 'These results suggest that a text's constituting words can predict its emotion potential.' 'When we read a text, specific words reverberate in our minds beyond the more complex message conveyed by the text; the art of choosing the right words with the appropriate affective impact is part of what defines the skill of good writers or speakers.' The study: 'The emotion potential of words and passages in reading Harry Potter – An fMRI study' is published in Brain and Language.\n",

            "A mentally disabled Colorado man was sentenced to 100 years in prison Friday for the murder of a Montana teacher whose death highlighted the downsides of an oil boom that's sweeping across the remote Northern Plains, bringing thousands of newcomers to the area. Michael Keith Spell, 25, of Parachute, Colorado, was sentenced following a hearing before state District Judge Richard Simonton in Sidney. Spell pleaded guilty in October to killing Sherry Arnold, 43, after attempting to abduct the popular math teacher as she was jogging near her home in 2012. Arnold's body was found months later buried in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. Co-defendant Lester Van Waters Jr. was sentenced in December to 80 years in prison on a charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. Sentenced to die behind bars: Michael Keith Spell, 25, sits in state District Court in Sidney, Mont, Friday April 17, 2015, before being sentenced to 100 years prison for the 2012 murder of a 43-year-old teacher in the booming Bakken oil patch of Montana . Murdered at random: Sherry Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared. She was pulled into a car by Spell and his friend, strangled to death, and then buried 50 miles away in North Dakota . Defense attorneys had asked that Spell be placed into custody of state health officials for placement in an institution for the mentally disabled. They claimed he was 'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old'. They said Spell's mental problems made him unable to conform to the law, making him eligible for commitment to the Montana Department of Health and Human Services. In the days before Arnold's killing, Spell and Waters traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and the men's previous testimony. The defendants came to the region looking for work in the booming Bakken oil patch. During their trip, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack \"brought the devil out in him\" and began talking about kidnapping and killing a woman, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Spell's attorneys alleged Waters threatened to kill Spell with a utility razor unless he went along with the kidnapping plan. After the pair spotted Arnold along a Sidney street, Spell tried to grab her, leading to a struggle in which Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated, authorities said. Co-accused: Lester Van Waters (left) was sentenced to 80 years in December.  He and Spell (right-in 2012) were under the influence of crack cocaine when they kidnapped and murder Mrs Arnold . Killed: Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Spell said during an October change-of-plea hearing that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Arnold's body was found months after her disappearance in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. For Sidney residents, Arnold's death offered a horrifying illustration of the social upheaval caused by an energy boom that has turned the once-sleepy town into an oil patch hub. Crime has spiked in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota over the past several years as traffickers of methamphetamine and other drugs seek to profit off oil workers flush with cash, according to law enforcement officials. Spell was spared a potential death sentence after state health officials agreed with the defense that he was mentally disabled. Guilty: In this February 2012 photo, Michael Keith Spell, appears at a hearing in the Williams County Courthouse in Williston. Defense attorneys wanted Spell sentenced to an institution for the mentally disabled . Dearly missed: Rhonda Whited-Rupp holds a picture of her sister, Sherry Arnold, seen in a cowboy hat, and Arnold's family. Michael Keith Spell was sentenced to 100 years prison Friday for the murder of Mrs Arnold . But Simonton in May rejected arguments from the defense that Spell's history of low IQ scores, his difficulty reading and other mental problems rendered him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors recommended 100 years in prison and thus became Spell's sentence Friday. Defense attorneys Al Avignone and Lisa Banick said Friday's judgment will be appealed based on their continued belief that he was not fit for trial. If the state Supreme Court agrees, Spell would be committed to a state mental institution, Avignone said.\n",

            "Eight San Francisco police officers accused of sending racist and homophobic text messages have been suspended, and the police chief is recommending that the veteran employees be sacked. Chief Greg Suhr announced in a statement Friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers . He called the texts 'despicable' and says those who sent them 'clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer.' Authorities say that the offensive texts targeting blacks, Mexicans, Filipinos and gay men, which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs, were sent between 2011 and 2012. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr (pictured) said that eight officers had been suspended and that he had recommended they be fired . Texts between San Francisco Police Department officers included racist, sexist and homophobic messages . Suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that don't have contact with the public. The messages were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant Ian Furminger, who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison. 'All n*****s must f*****g hang' and 'N*****s must be spayed' were among the texts uncovered. 'It's not against the law to put an animal down,' an officer said, referring to a black man in Furminger's house. Other texts were offensive to women and repeatedly used the word f**. The eight officers include Captain Jason Fox, 42, a two decade veteran and Sergeant Michael Wibunsin, a 12-year veteran, according to the San Francisco Chronicle's sources. Officers identified as Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year-veteran, Noel Schwab, 49, a 16-year-veteran and Michael Celis, who has been on the force for 16 years, have reportedly already resigned or said they will resign. Sean Doherty, an 11-year veteran and Rain Daugherty, a 15-year-officer, are also facing termination. Robison, Schwab and Celis have reportedly already resigned. Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year veteran of the force, has resigned. He gave an interview to the Advocate in 1999 (pictured) about being a gay officer. He said 'the \"good ol' boys\" system is on its way out' The offensive text messages were uncovered after federal corruption charges were brought against former SFPD sergeant Ian Furminger, who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last month . The eighth officer has not yet been identified, and was not aware about possible dismissal as of Friday. Robison is openly gay and told the LGBT magazine The Advocate in 1998: 'The \"good ol' boys\" system is on its way out, and the newer generation that's replaced them sees things from a more open-minded standpoint' He was accused of using a racial epithet against a suspect in the mid 1990s but the allegation was dismissed. In 2007 an officer named Jason Fox was accused of hitting a gay man's head against the wall and using his hair to clean up urine on the street outside a club. 'Do you think we want your AIDS-infected pee on our streets?’ Fox allegedly said. He  did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed. Police commissioners at the time reached a $83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man. The SFPD did not respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online about whether the incident involved the same Jason Fox accused in the text message scandal. San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed . Minutes from a San Francisco Family Violence Council meeting show that Fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013. Celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife's hotel room. Wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011. Public Defender Jeff Adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed. He has called for the Department of Justice to investigate San Francisco's police as it did with officers in Ferguson, Missouri, according to KQED.\n",

            "There was no glorious Team Sky send-off for Sir Bradley Wiggins despite a terrific effort from the Briton in the Paris-Roubaix. The 2012 Tour de France winner is quitting the team in order to ride for his own squad, 'Wiggins', before a return to the track ahead of the Rio Olympics, and wanted to sign off from what he called a 'golden era' with a win in one of the sport's most prestigious races. But it was not to be as Germany's John Degenkolb produced the perfect race to cross the line first at the end of a gruelling 151-mile trek which took in 27 tortuous cobbled spells. Bradley Wiggins sits on the floor after failing to win his final race with Team Sky in the Parsi-Roubaix . Wiggins left everything on the road as he attempted to bow out in glorious fashion, but was unable to hold on . German John Degenkolb celebrates as he crosses the line, winning the race ahead of Wiggins in 18th . Wiggins did his best, breaking away with 32 kilometres left to shake things up at the head of the peloton, while he also made a late push, but in the end he had to settle for a place down the line in 18th as Degenkolb took the glory. In the process he became the first rider to take first in the Milan San Remo and Paris-Roubaix in the same year since Sean Kelly back in 1986. One of the sport's classic races, the one-day slog did not fail to disappoint, but the drama almost got out of hand at one stage as some of the riders had a lucky escape when a train sped through the tracks they were due to cross. Some of the field slipped across despite the safety barriers being down, while others were held at the gate before being able to resume. Degenkolb celebrates his win alongside Zdenek Stybar (left) and Greg van Avermaet (right) Wiggins led a breakaway with 32 kilometres remaining, but was unable to maintain his lead to win . After that interlude the drama returned to the saddle, although Sky's in-form Geraint Thomas was unable to play a part. Amongst the early front-runners he was unseated when he ran into a curb, while he also suffered injuries on the way which eventually reduced him to a participant. For Wiggins it was always going to be a case of leaving nothing on the road ahead of his next phase, which is to include a ride at the Tour de Yorkshire. He first made himself known in the race when he moved to the head of the peloton with 45 kilometres to go and, with 32 remaining he ditched the pack in a bid to reel in the leaders. The peloton drew him back but his intent was clear and he held pace with them until Greg van Avermaet and Yves Lampaert went for it on their own. Luke Rowe (right) finished ahead of Wiggins in the end, coming in eighth, Team Sky's best performance . The pair were joined by Degenkolb and then Zdenek Stybar and at this point it was clear Wiggins' race was run. He found some extra power to go it alone again but the top prize was no longer on the table for him and he was amongst the rest as Degenkolb won the race in two laps of the Roubaix Velodrome. In the end Luke Rowe was Sky's first man home in eighth, while Stybar and Van Avermaet took second and third respectively.\n",

            "Jose Mourinho might have called it poetic justice as Ashley Barnes was sent off on the stroke of half-time to deliver a major blow to Burnley's prospects of staying in the Premier League. Burnley were left feeling hard-done-by as referee Mike Jones denied them a couple of possible penalties and more significantly allowed Kevin Mirallas to stay on the pitch for a tackle worse than anything Barnes did. All that would be called karma in Mourinho's book. The Chelsea manager condemned the Burnley forward for a 'criminal challenge' on Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge in February when he escaped unpunished and Matic was sent off for retaliation. Everton forward Kevin Mirallas (right) opens the scoring on his return to the first team at Goodison Park . The Belgium international gestures after handing Everton the lead in their 1-0 defeat of Burnley . Everton midfielder Ross Barkley walks away with his head held low after missing a chance to give his side the lead from the spot . Burnley forward Ashley Barnes reacts after being shown the red car by referee Mike Jones just before half time . Everton (4-3-3): Howard 6; Coleman 7.5, Stones 6.5, Jagielka 6.5, Baines 7; McCarthy 6 (Besic 88), Barry 6, Barkley 6; Lennon 8, Kone 6.5 (Naismith 80), Mirallas 6.5 (Lukaku 61 6) Unused subs: Robles (Gk), Garbutt, Alcaraz, McGeady .

On Saturday, Barnes wasn't so lucky, getting a first yellow card for an attempted sliding tackle on James McCarthy and a second for a foul on Seamus Coleman. 'It was just two silly challenges, not malicious,' said Dyche. 'But at least the referee got that one right.' That was a pithy way of explaining he was less than happy with Mr Jones for denying Burnley penalties for a John Stones challenge on Barnes and an attempt by McCarthy to bring down Scott Arfield. And he was furious that Mirallas stayed on the pitch for a high lunge on George Boyd early in the second half. 'That was the biggest one. It's impossible he stays on the football pitch for a challenge like that,' said Dyche. 'High, late. I've no clue why it wasn't a red card. 'I don't want to see players surround referees. We don't. Maybe we should because other teams would have done after the Mirallas challenge. 10 v 10 is a lot easier than 10 v 11 and we would have fancied our chances.' Predictably, Everton boss Roberto Martinez had an opposite viewpoint. 'I don't think it was a red card at all. He stands on his feet in the challenge. It was well-controlled,' he added before slightly contradicting himself. 'It was a typical striker's challenge.'

The young Evertonian strikes the ball with conviction as Burnley players race forward to clear any danger . Barkley strikes the ball low and to the left but Burnley keeper Tom Heaton is equal to it with an excellent save . Burnley No 1 Heaton blows a sigh of relief after preventing Everton from taking the lead . Decisions aside, it was clear Everton were the better team on the pitch and deserved the victory given to them after 29 minutes when Arouna Kone dummied Seamus Coleman's cross and Mirallas finished at the second attempt for his 10th goal of the season. They had already missed a penalty from Ross Barkley by that stage. Burnley's Tom Heaton was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers and when the visitors had a late chance to equalise, it fell to out-of-sorts Danny Ings who headed Kieran Trippier's cross wide. Burnley's brave battle against the drop is in danger of running out of steam, perhaps due to Dyche's policy of naming unchanged teams. Leicester's win leaves The Clarets bottom of the table having scored only one goal in seven matches. They face Leicester next weekend and it's a must-win, . If they been spurred on by the record-breaking Test cricket achievements in the Caribbean of Burnley fan Jimmy Anderson, it didn't show. After ten minutes, David Jones pulled down Aaron Lennon on the edge of the box and they both fell inside. Baines, whose Premier League record from the spot is 15 out of 16, didn't take it. Barkley did and the effort was saved by Heaton with Martinez unconvincingly stating afterwards he applauded the youngster's confidence for stepping up. At least it didn't deny Everton a win as Mirallas had done when he grabbed the ball of Baines against West Brom in January and missed his penalty. 'I was very pleased with the overall performance. The scoreline shows you a clean sheet and we had 20 attempts to score,' said Martinez whose side could still finish a moderate season in the top half of the table. Burnley would bite your hand off at 17th and Dyche still believes in the great escape. 'I thought we were decent in the first half and excellent in the second when we were a man down.'

            "Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five-year contract to lure him away from Manchester City this summer. Despite the fact Toure turns 32 next month, Roberto Mancini is so desperate to sign the powerful midfielder that he's ready to give the Ivory Coast midfielder a deal that will see him play beyond his 37th birthday. Mancini, who signed Toure for Manchester City in 2010, is working hard behind the scenes to bring Toure to Serie A next season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure remains a top target for Serie A giants Inter Milan . Toure, pictured with Vincent Kompany, will be offered a new deal by Manchester City in the summer . Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is keen on bringing Toure to the San Siro . The Italian believes Toure has the capacity to dominate games in Serie A well into his mid-30s, like Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has. The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns £220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England. The 31-year-old scored a consolation goal in Manchester City's surprise 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace . Toure walks off the Selhurst Park pitch following his side's Premier League defeat at Selhurst Park .\n",

            "It is a skill employed by stand-up comedians, politicians and market traders alike – an effortless way with words that can persuade, cajole and tease. Now scientists believe they have found evidence of what may lie behind 'the gift of the gab'. Brain scans on a group of professional comedians has revealed differences in the way the brains of these 'super speakers' work while talking. The ultimate wheeler dealer, Del Boy's gift of the gab came from a difference in the way his brain worked . Compared to the less silver tongued among us, the super speakers – which also included a barrister and a radio presenter – showed less activity in a key area of the brain involved articulating and comprehending speech. This suggests that this group were putting less effort into the basic mechanics of speech, allowing them to devote more resources to what they were going to say next. Sarcasm is often described as the lowest form of wit, but it seems you need the right kind of wits in the first place to be able to recognise it. Neuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic. They found that people with damage to the right sagittal stratum - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm. Stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic. Dr Joe Devlin, a neuroscientist at University College London, told the Guardian: 'The fact that they show less activity there reflects the fact that they simply find speech less effortful and I suspect part of that has to do with practice. ' The findings may also help to explain why some people dry up completely when asked to speak. Dr Devlin and his colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brains of 17 professional comedians, a radio presenter and barrister. They were asked to lie in the scanner while talking for 30 seconds on random topics without hesitation, deviation or repetition – a task based on the BBC 4 panel show Just a Minute. Among the comedians taking part were Robin Ince, who presents a show with physicist Brian Cox, Richard Herring and Helen Keen. They were compared against a control group of students, who, according to Dr Devlin, were far less adept at the task. Super speakers were found to have less activity in Broca's region of the brain, shown in the image above . Dr Devlin said: 'One of the participants was given \"Scotland\" and just said \"I've never been there\", and that was basically it. 'We asked them to speak about \"a perfect cup of tea\", topics that should've been easy for everyone. 'A lot of our interest in speaking in fluency has been about things that go wrong, such as stutters. There's been almost no interest in how speech goes right.' The study revealed that the same areas of the brain were activated when both the comedians and the students were speaking. Market traders are known for their ability to sell almost anything to anyone due to their talent for speaking . However, the comedians and other super speakers showed lower levels of activity in an area of the brain known as Broca's region. Perhaps surprisingly, some studies have shown that Broca's region is also underactive in people who stutter. Writing on his blog about being involved in the research, comedian Richard Herring said: ' I was secretly hoping they would discover that my grey matter was special in some way or had some additional little bend or section which enabled me to be so very funny. 'The testers did say that the control group of non-professional speakers found the idea of talking on a surprise subject very difficult.'\n",

            "An online fitness and diet star is facing court action over an unpaid $300,000 tax debt. Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. The debts, which were due last May, include income and tax, a fine and $295,955 worth of interest. Scroll down for video . Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago . Court documents show the tax office launched action in November and has since lodged an application to liquidate ABBBC Pty Ltd - the company behind Ms Bines' bikini body challenge program. The case will be heard in a Brisbane court next Friday with Pilot Partners already consenting to be liquidators if the tax office wins. Ms Bines and her husband Steven Evans have reportedly sold their shares in ABBBC to Platinum Investment Group - a second company they are members and shareholders of. The fitness queen gave up her title as director of ABBBC just six months after they first started in April 2012. Her husband remained as the sole director of the company. But Mr Evans handed directorship of ABBBC to business associate Levi Walz in January. Mr Evans is currently locked in a court battle with rival fitness guru Emily Anderson. The Gold Coast model and body builder is suing Mr Evans for $500,000 for allegedly using her money for his other businesses and failing to promote hers effectively. Court documents show the tax office launched action in November and has since lodged an application to close down ABBBC Pty Ltd - the company behind Ms Bines' bikini body challenge program . Ms Bines and her husband Steven Evans reportedly sold their shares in ABBBC to Platinum Investment Group - a second company they are members and shareholders of . Ms Anderson launched her company 'Emily Skye 30 Day 2 Shred' in February 2013 with Steven Evans as a joint director. He allegedly made contact with Ms Anderson via Facebook in 2013 to propose a business partnership, promising to 'make something' of her like he did with his wife Ashy. Ms Anderson's company is seeking damages against Mr Evans for up to $501,619 for allegedly spending the business' money on personal items and expenses relating to other businesses. One of the payments listed in the court claim includes $2,500 paid to the Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported at the time. It comes after Sydney personal trainer Allie Dodds said last week that Ms Bines had used her recipes in a $100 e-book without crediting her or asking if she could publish them in a book. The fitness queen gave up her title as director of ABBBC just six months after they first started in April 2012 . It comes after Ms Bines admitted in a video statement that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen . Ms Dodds regularly published recipes for her friends and family on her Mealspiration blog before she started her business, The Sweet Sweat, in September 2013. She said Ms Bines contacted her asking if she could share her recipes online with her Facebook fan base and she agreed. 'I thought, that was OK she's going to share a couple of my recipes, give me some credit and that was it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. But she said she was stunned when a colleague noticed her Salmon and Cauliflower Sushi recipe in a 2012 edition of Ms Bines' Clean Eating Recipe Book. Ms Bines admitted in a video statement that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen. She said it happened because she 'outsourced' the recipe component to an unnamed nutritionist.

            "A former jewelry store worker has been arrested for his alleged role in the abduction and torture of a female employee at the business. Khayree Gay, 31, was captured on Friday at the Security Inn and Suites hotel in Lake City, South Carolina, according to a report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Gay, who is originally from Feltonville, Pennsylvania, is facing federal charges for allegedly kidnapping a Jewelers Row employee on April 4 in Philadelphia. Scroll down for video . Khayree Gay, 31, was captured last Friday at the Security Inn and Suites hotel in Lake City, South Carolina for his alleged role in the botched jewelry store heist . The 53-year-old female victim was seen walking through the parking garage on April 4 shortly before she was grabbed and thrown into a van . The Ford van was seen on surveillance tape making its way to the roof of the garage where the woman was told she was going to die by men in ski masks unless she handed over the code for the jewelry store safe . The 53-year-old female employee of the National Watch and Diamond Exchange in downtown Philadelphia was leaving work earlier this month shortly before 4pm when she was pulled into a Ford van in a parking garage. She was driven to the building's roof, beaten and shot with a Taser seven times. She was told she was going to die by the three men in ski masks,Philly.com reported. According to authorities, the woman was told to hand over codes to the safe which she did not know. She handed over her ATM card, which the suspects used to fill the van with gas, and was taken to a cemetery where she was zip-tied and dumped from the van. She freed her hands and tied to flee but the suspects returned and put her in shackles and handcuffs. The suspects again demanded information from the woman who was unable to tell them anything and they abandoned her in the cemetery. The woman was treated at a local hospital for broken ribs and a concussion. The victim, whose identity has not been released, was traumatized by what had happened, police reported.

            "Second child: Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrives yesterday . A top executive at Goldman Sachs secretly filmed colleagues to record their ‘sexist’ behaviour when she became pregnant. Sonia Pereiro-Mendez says she was denied millions in pay and bonuses when she announced she was expecting her first child. Male colleagues at the bank were promoted ahead of her and she was ‘mocked’ and subjected to ‘gratuitous derogatory’ comments about her childcare arrangements, she alleges. So in an attempt to prove her claim, she recorded managers at the global investment firm ‘without their knowledge’, a tribunal heard yesterday. The executive director in distressed investing – which concerns companies in financial difficulties – is suing her employer for sex and maternity discrimination. She has also lodged a claim against three senior bosses – Bryan Mix, the global head of loan trading, Nicholas Pappas, who is European head of distressed trading, and Simon Morris, global head of credit trading. Yesterday Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrived with her second child for the first day of the hearing at Central London Employment Tribunal, which was told she would need breaks during proceedings to breastfeed. The hearing was not told who was recorded by Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, although they are likely to be among the 15 or so witnesses due to be called during the tribunal. The revelation was made by the bank’s counsel Daniel Stilitz QC, who said: ‘One key point is that... the claimant recorded some of the managers without their knowledge.’ Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, who speaks fluent German and Spanish, joined Goldman Sachs in 2003 and moved to London in 2005 after a stint in Frankfurt. But over a five-year period she claims her income took a hit because bosses ‘felt, given her pregnancy, she was no longer a significant long-term player’. Her basic salary was £250,000 in January 2010 but by January 2012 – two months after announcing her pregnancy – it had fallen to £192,000. She was also entitled to a bonus of about five per cent of the profit she generated. But in 2011 she received £200,000 rather than the £910,000 she claims she was owed. Goldman Sachs executive Sonia Pereiro-Mendez  claims after she became pregnant she was cheated out of millions of pounds . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez claims men were promoted ahead of her at the bank (pictured) while she was ‘publicly mocked,’ and subjected to ‘gratuitous and implicitly derogatory references to her childcare arrangements' Mrs Pereiro-Mendez says her bonuses and salary were cut over five years . The following year she was paid £284,000 but says she should have got a further £475,000. By 2014 there was no bonus at all, although she says she should have been given £450,000. In her claim, she says she took ‘exceptional measures’ to perform her work during maternity leave. She would attend meetings, on one occasion asking in-laws to look after the child in a car park – enabling her to ‘swiftly breastfeed her baby during breaks’. Goldman Sachs, Mr Pappas, Mr Morris and Mr Mix all deny the allegations against them . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez has accused her former manager, Allen Ukritnukun, of excluding her from meetings, claiming he ‘publicly mocked’ her before male peers ‘for no good reason’. He also allegedly ‘made overt sexist comments’, which once amounted to ‘explicit sexual harrassment’. Mr Ukritnukun was later promoted to managing director, enabling him to become ‘emboldened in his contemptuous conduct’. Mr Ukritnukun vehemently denies the allegations made against him by Ms Pereiro-Mendez and is particularly distressed by the allegation that he made a comment which amounted to sexual harassment. She also says Mr Pappas made ‘overtly discriminatory comments’ during a business trip to Germany.

            "Michael Bisping is eyeing a long-awaited homecoming ahead of his fight against CB Dollaway. The Manchester middleweight takes on Dollaway in Montreal on Saturday night bidding to avoid losing successive fights for the first time in his career. And assuming he does so, Bisping is open to fighting again in Glasgow this July, five years since he last fought in the UK. Michael Bisping gets up close to CB Dolloway during the UFC 186 weigh-in at Metropolis on Friday . ‘I know it’s a cliche but I feel like I’m in the best shape of my life. I’m ready to take on the world, and by world I mean CB Dollaway,’ he said. ‘For me it’s just another day in the office. This is what I love to do, this is what I was put on this earth to do. ‘Make no mistake, I’m going to deliver for the fans in Montreal. ‘He’s going to look for a takedown, I’m going to stop that takedown. ‘I’m in the best training situation of my life – if I had this type of training my entire career, I’d have been a world champion five years ago. I just have to prove to the world I’m still one of the best. I’ll beat CB, then I’ll beat someone else and then you’ll hear me start talking about that title shot again. ‘I haven’t fought in the UK in five years. After this fight, if the UFC wants me to fight on the Glasgow card I’ll do it. I’ll fight anywhere in the UK. I’m an Englishman at heart and it’s been far too long since I’ve been able to fight in the UK.’ Bisping looks to get back to winning ways against Dolloway  in Canada this weekend . Bisping is coming off the back of a defeat by Luke Rockhold last November but still considers himself among the best in the world. ‘I’m expecting the best CB Dollaway there is, and I expect him to be confident. But his courage will diminish as the fight goes on, and I will knock him out,’ he added. ‘CB Dollaway is a very good athlete. He’s a great wrestler, he’s a mediocre striker – I’m by far a better striker. ‘I’ve never lost two fights back to back. I need to put a win streak together. But I still consider myself one of the best in the world. ‘The last fight against Rockhold, we clashed heads and I couldn’t see too well – he caught me with a head kick and that was it. ‘I know I’ve had my setbacks, they’ve been well documented. There’s no shame in losing to the guys I’ve lost to; they’re all guys who could be world champions. Dana White called me after the Luke Rockhold fight and told me the reason I was losing fights is because I’m consistently fighting the best guys in the world – not everyone can say that. ‘I’m going to prove that I’m still one of the best in the world.’\n",

            "After Tony Blair’s speech in his former constituency of Sedgefield last week, the former PM made an appearance at a low-key private fundraising dinner for 15 Labour target seats. But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna’s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair’s popularity. Brookstein’s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It’s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair’s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: ‘Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.’ Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned £303,000 in addition to his MP’s salary, mostly from £1,600-an-hour appearances on Iran’s Press TV and Russia Today. The national treasure that is Andrew Marr gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign. ‘There’s this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life. To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,’ he writes in The Spectator. ‘They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don’t want to talk about taxation. ‘The deficit? Apparently if it’s left alone it’s just going to melt away. Huddled-down, risk-averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children.’ Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's 'Controls On Immigration' mug embarrassing . Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour’s embarrassing ‘Controls On Immigration’ mug at the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in her Sky News interview yesterday. Cooper coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras. ‘A storm in a coffee cup,’ Cooper, aka Mrs Ed Balls, said. The influential Labour Uncut blog says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon’s claim that Red Ed Miliband ‘stabbed his own brother in the back’ to lead Labour, and would do the same to Britain by negotiating away Trident, will help the Tories. ‘The manner in which Ed Miliband defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with Labour canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of Ed Miliband as an untrustworthy leader,’ the website says. ‘The gutter is an ugly place to be but. . . it’s where elections are won.’ Plaid Cymru is under pressure to dump its candidate for Ceredigion, Mike Parker, for saying in 2001 English-born inhabitants of rural Wales were ‘gun-toting final solution crackpots’. In other words, Nazis. Parker said he was ‘young and angry at the time’. He was 34. Gaffe of the day: Anna Firth, Tory candidate in Labour-held Erith and Thamesmead, posted pictures of litter on the streets to shame her political opponent — but they were from streets in neighbouring Bexley, controlled by the Tories who are responsible for refuse collection. Hillary's now a Tory pin-up . Spotted in Chelmsford yesterday: Simon Burns, the defending Tory MP, wearing a T-shirt and wrist watch emblazoned with the features of his political hero. Not David Cameron but Hillary Clinton, pictured, who announced her candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Students of American history will know that yesterday was also the 70th anniversary of the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, America’s longest-serving president, who was a Democrat.

            "Fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA, researchers have discovered. Dating back hundreds of thousands of years, the instinct to avoid arachnids developed as an evolutionary response to a dangerous threat, the academics suggest. It could mean that arachnophobia, one of the most crippling of phobias, represents a finely tuned survival instinct. And it could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom have existed millions of years ago. Scroll down for video . Researchers say a fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA and dates back thousands of years, Stock photo . Study leader Joshua New, of Columbia University in New York, said: ‘A number of spider species with potent, vertebratespecific venoms populated Africa long before hominoids and have co-existed there for tens of millions of years. ‘Humans were at perennial, unpredictable and significant risk of encountering highly venomous spiders in their ancestral environments. ‘Even when not fatal, a black widow spider bite in the ancestral world could leave one incapacitated for days or even weeks, terribly exposed to dangers,’ he told the Sunday Times. The research team carried out an experiment in which 252 volunteers were asked to study computer screens containing abstract shapes and data. Their reactions to images of spiders were very fast, even if their shape was distorted, when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear, such as needles and flies. The researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot. Dr New said: ‘Detection, therefore, is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters — any improvements to the sensitivity, vigilance, reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage.’ The instinct could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago.

            "Kenwyne Jones came from the bench late on to score within three minutes of his Bournemouth debut and rescue a point away to Ipswich. The pass the parcel of the Championship top spot continued as Bournemouth could only draw after falling behind to an early Freddie Sears goal. They dominated the match, but had to wait until the 82nd minute for Jones, taken on loan from Cardiff 10 days ago, to power in a header.

Sears (left) converted from close range to put Ipswich ahead in the early exchanges of the game . Bournemouth (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Cook (Jones 79), Elphick, Daniels; Ritchie, Surman, Arter, Fraser (Smith 78); Pitman (Kermorgant 65), Wilson. Subs not used: Camp, Ward, Gosling, MacDonald.

Subs not used: Gerken,, Anderson, Williams, McGoldrick. Manager: Mick McCarthy . Booked: Chambers . Goal: Sears, 6 . Referee: Robert Madley . Attendance: 22,672 . ‘We scored an un-Bournemouth goal,’ manager Eddie Howe admitted afterwards. ‘But it was equally effective as any, from a set piece. It’s good to see, we haven’t come back from being behind much this season. ‘Jones is a presence, but he’s more than that he’s got good feet, he was excellent when he came on. He’s very important in terms of scores like this and the situation the game was in. That’s when he’s probably going to play his biggest part. It’s his job to turn those into points for us. He could be invaluable.’ All it took was a split second lapse in concentration from Bournemouth’s defence and they were behind in only the sixth minute. The first half was still taking shape when Daryl Murphy was afforded time and space on the right inside the box to bring a cross under control with a lovely touch and pass into Sears to fire in first-time. The striker, formerly of West Ham, was so free he looked over to the linesman, fearing he was offside, but the flag stayed down and he notched up his 19th goal of the campaign. Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski was diving left, right and centre for the remainder of the game to keep his side ahead. Twice he denied Ryan Fraser and again a powerful effort from Matt Ritchie. But Jones was thrown on in the 79th minute and rose to meet Ritchie’s left-hand side corner to finally beat the Polish keeper. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy said: ’They put a very, very, very expensive acquisition on. He is pretty good in the air. I’ve just watched it and Tommy Smith is head-to-head with him, it’s one of those you get your head on it sometimes it flies in sometimes it doesn’t. He’s started to pay a bit back, I’d say.’ Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy shakes hands with Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe before the game .

Bialkowski pulled off his save of the match in stoppage time, making a one-handed stop at full-stretch to reach substitute Yann Kermorgant’s header from another Ritchie corner. Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, but no-one is able to get a grip at the top of the Championship table. ‘I’ve not known a league change hands so much,’ Howe added. ‘I’ve not known it so tight. It’s crazy. I said a few weeks ago there could be plenty more twists and turns. ‘I think everyone is hoping they can be the team which breaks away. With so few games to go now it looks unlikely. It all goes down to the team who can hold their nerve the most and who can continue to avoid the pressure of what’s at stake.’\n",

            "An exotic animal owner from Ohio is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in January. In total, six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger (part lion, part tiger) were taken from Kenny Hetrick's Stony Ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were 'unsafe'. Authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of  wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern Ohio released 56 exotic animals - including lions and  tigers - then killed himself. Apparently Hetrick has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72-year-old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure, backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie doesn't pose a threat. Scroll down for video . Feeling lost: Kenny Hetrick is campaigning for his tigers, leopards and bears to be returned after they were seized by the state in January . They have organized car washes and handed him envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars to pay legal bills. Some spent the winter shoring up his cages with taller fences and netting, hoping the animals will return. 'He's lost without them,' said Josh Large, who lives four houses away. 'A lot of us are lost without them.' Hetrick allowed anyone to visit at no charge, getting by with help from volunteers and donations of cash, as well as of deer and horse meat to feed his animals. He thought of himself as an educator, inviting scout troops and families to learn what they wouldn't hear at zoos. Flashback: In total six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger were taken from Hetrick's farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit - here he is seen in 2014 with his pet bear . However, the 2011 incident mentioned earlier pushed Ohio to tighten regulations on 'private zoos'. Owners are now required to have sturdy cages, background checks and insurance before receiving an annual permit. Since the beginning of last year, Ohio has issued permits to 54 exotic animal enthusiasts. Others gave up their animals or moved them out of state rather than make the changes. 'I know I didn't have everything done, but I thought they'd work with me,' said Hetrick, who acknowledged before his animals were taken that he couldn't afford everything the state wanted. The agriculture department says that it tried, but that he never responded to letters sent over a span of two years with the permit application materials until last October, nine months after the deadline, when it gave him ten days to surrender his animals. State officials in January rejected his application for a permit, which includes a $1,000 fee, saying it submitted was too late. They also said state inspectors who visited the sanctuary outside Toledo last November discovered the tigers could stand on their housing and get dangerously near the top of their cages. The inspection noted there were unsecured padlocks and chains and not enough fencing around an enclosure holding a tiger and black leopard. 'If motivated, it would be very easy for either of those two animals to escape,' said Melissa Simmerman, assistant state veterinarian. Hetrick, whose pickup truck has 'Tiger Man' painted on the side, disputes those assertions. 'Nothing's ever got loose. Not in almost 40 years,' he said. 'Nobody's ever been bit. Nobody's been hurt.' Empty: A sign affixed to a cage at Tiger Ridge Exotics in Stony Ridge, Ohio, indicates that it is the home of Cody the bear - Cody and 10 other exotic animals were seized by the state in January . Lonesome: Only Chief the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law . The Ohio Department of Agriculture has a duty to protect the public's safety, spokeswoman Erica Hawkins said. 'Just because an animal's never gotten out, doesn't mean that an animal couldn't get out,' she said. Hetrick is appealing the department's rejection of his permit application and a hearing is scheduled for next week, but the fight will probably continue in court no matter what a state panel decides. Until then, the ten animals - a lion named Leo that had been in failing health was euthanized by the state last week - will remain a two-hour drive away outside Columbus, in a high-security building operated by the state. 'Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at Tiger Ridge Exotics who have been held illegally and long neglected. Now, it's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo—a potentially life-threatening move. This is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need. PETA is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first.' Source: Toledo News Now . Supporters of Hetrick believe the animals - only the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law - have been mistreated and will not survive long outside their home. State officials insist they are fine. Hetrick doesn't have formal training with wild animals, but he has been around them about 60 years, since he was a ten-year-old volunteer cleaning cages at a zoo in Tarpon Springs, Florida. His love for wild creatures grew when he moved to Ohio. He first brought home an ocelot, often called a dwarf leopard. 'I tell people don't start with a tiger if you don't know what you're doing,' he said. He and his wife, who died four years ago, spent much of the money he made as an auto worker and police officer on the animals. Even with donations, food alone for the tigers and others cost as much as $15,000 annually in recent years. Their collection multiplied, often when others dropped off unwanted pets. His daughter, Corrina Hetrick, remembers going out to catch the school bus only to find an alligator swimming in a kiddie pool. There also was the time a black panther showed up in the back of a pickup truck. 'I didn't have cats and dogs,' she said. 'I had bears and tigers.' Even the circus camped at his two-acre property while traveling between shows. 'We had elephants in the backyard and contortionists in the living room,' she said. Erica Crawford, who has been visiting Hetrick's animals since she was a little girl and now brings her children, said she appreciates the uniqueness of the place. 'There's never been a time,' she said, 'where I felt like it's not safe there.'\n",

            "Police put extra security measures in place after a kiwi man associated with Islamic State urged followers to launch attacks targeting Anzac Day commemorations. Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor, who claims to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria, posted a video on YouTube in an attempt to incite violent acts in Australia and New Zealand during services commemorating Anzac Day's centenary. In the video, which has since been removed after 3 News notified authorities, Taylor instructed fellow jihadists to act out against police and soldiers. 'Now is the time to commence your operations, even if it means you have to stab a few police officers, soldiers on Anzac Day and so be it.' Scroll down for video . Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor has posted a video to Youtube urging IS sympathisers to attack Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand . New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed Taylor was 'known to New Zealand authorities' and that this was not his first attempt at publicly 'airing his views'. Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services. 'We take our responsibility for the safety and security of New Zealanders very seriously and, while we are unable to go into detail, we have already taken further security measures.' Police in New Zealand have confirmed they have implemented extra security measures amid growing concerns of a targeted terror attack . 'Zealanders should feel confident in attending Anzac Day events as planned, while exercising their usual vigilance in light of the current global security environment,' Mr Bush said. Prime Minister John Key told 3 News the troubling video only further confirms that IS are a growing threat to New Zealand and its people. 'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand.' Mr Key told reporters that while IS enjoy 'inciting fear' by publicising the atrocities they commit, the group are under extreme scrutiny. 'Those people are under…a pretty significant watch from the authorities, so we will continue to watch those people very, very closely.' 'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand' 'Now is the time to commence your operations, even if it means you have to stab a few police officers, soldiers on Anzac Day and so be it' Taylor, who left in May 2012 despite having his passport cancelled, is one of very few New Zealanders who are known to be fighting for Islamic State militants in Syria. He reportedly burned his passport upon crossing the Syrian boarder and posted to Facebook that his move to Syria was a 'one-way trip, no going back', the Guardian reported. Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location in Syria to the whole world. While some claimed he did this unknowingly branding him the 'bumbling jihadi', Taylor said he had 'every intention' to display his location.

Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location to the world . This comes only weeks after an Anzac Day terror plot was foiled by Australian authorities when 200 officers raided properties in south east Melbourne. Five men were arrested and it was revealed they were allegedly plotting to run over a police officer, savage him with a knife and steal his gun so they could embark on a shooting rampage in the streets of Melbourne on Anzac Day. Two of the five men arrested in the pre-dawn raids remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court . A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, was being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. A British teenager was also arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during Anzac Day commemorations. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire, allegedly communicated with Australian men who had planned to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day. Police said the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after they intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested  on suspicion that he was instigating a beheading, again on Australian soil. The Australian Federal Police confirmed the 14-year-old's arrest was linked to counter terrorism operations in Australia. Five men were arrested in anti-terror raids in Melbourne, after the culmination of a month-long operation code-named Operation Rising .\n",

            "A Dartmouth College judicial committee has 'derecognized' a fraternity that partly inspired the 1978 cult classic 'Animal House' because some new members received brands on their backsides. It found Alpha Delta responsible for causing harm to pledges and violating terms of a suspension for alcohol violations. The fraternity has until next Monday to appeal the decision. Alpha Delta President Ryan Maguire said members are disappointed and exploring options. Booted out: A Dartmouth College judicial committee has 'derecognized' Alpha Delta after several pledges received brands on their backsides . Regardless of the outcome of an appeal, Inge-Lise Ameer, interim dean, has the authority to withdraw recognition of Alpha Delta. She's taken evidence from the committee under advisement. Attorney George Ostler said last month Alpha Delta acknowledged a small group of members voluntarily chose to get brands on their backsides, but said the practice - which he compared to a form of self-expression akin to piercing and tattoos - was never a condition of membership and has since stopped. A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a whistleblower. By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid 'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'. When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker first reported last month. Toga! The 46-year-old Greek organization partly inspired the 1978 National Lampoon's Animal House starring John Belushi (pictured center) He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected. Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension. This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. Making changes: Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced this year a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future . A 1992 Rolling Stone article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'. Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time. The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity. The Greek organization has received bad publicity over the past four years. In 2011, two students were hurt when they plummeted from the roof of the Alpha Delta house, reported Valley News. Two years later, the notorious frat was indicted for serving alcohol to minors. That same year, Alpha Delta was force to issue an apology for organizing a 'Bloods and Crips' themed party. Then in October 2014, Alpha Delta was suspended for committing alcohol violations. Earlier this year, Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future that included high-risk drinking, sexual assault and a lack of inclusiveness on campus. The college is banning hard liquor on campus, ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups to reduce hazing, developing a mandatory sexual violence prevention program and creating new residential communities. Alpha Delta was initially founded by members of the Gamma Sigma Society but dissociated from its parent corporation and renamed itself The Alpha Delta Fraternity in 1969.\n",

Not your usual day out! Floating on clear deep water and reflections near the cave entrance, visitors can either bring their own kayaks or rent boats from the local community to paddle deep inside the cave and marvel at its wonders . Tham Khoun Ex caves, commonly known as Xe Bang Fai River caves, feature imposing stalagmitemade of mineral deposits. With over 15km (nine miles) of awe-inspiring passages and wide expanses of water, it really is one of Laos' hidden treasures. There is even a vibrant forest thriving at the upstream entrance to the caves, the lush green colour contrasting with the  enormous white and orange banks of terraces flowstone that decorates the walls. Visitors are able to kayak through the waters, or explore adjacent chambers on foot. The cave is only able to be safely accessed during the dry season from November to April and during this time the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue. For some of the grander shots, a team of four equipped with powerful LED lights and walkie-talkies helped to light-paint this enormous cavern for this long exposure shot. In 2008, an expedition, co-led by veteran caver John Pollack lead to the mysterious  caves being mapped and photographed for the first time. What the explorers discovered about the little-known cavern was a vast river cave, which means a cavern with an active water source flowing through it. 'Everything about the cave is big-from its towering entrances to its phobia-inducing spiders, which can be 10inches across,' Pollack told National Geographic. Nature at its best! The upstream inflow entrance of Tham Khoun Xe has a verdant forest inside a huge collapsed doline. It is possible to kayak from the resurgence to here and back in one full day . Hidden secrets! Massive formations abound in a newly discovered fossil section of the cave, 50 metres above the river level. This section, encrusted with delicate formations and not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances on . Gigantic! The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 60 metres long and is probably one of the worldís largest rimstone basins . American cave explorer Dave Pierce marvels at giant cave pearls which grow like pearls in an oyster with concentric layers of calcite slowly building up year after year . Lit up!

In the dry season from November to April, the only part of the year safe to visit the cave, the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue . This gigantic section, is also not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances . The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 196 feet long and is probably one of the world's largest rimstone basins. The pool is filled with water during the wet season. The rims of basins like this grow taller each year as calcite precipitates from cave water as it flows faster over protrusions . The immense proportions of Tham Khuon Xe, one of the worldís greatest river caves, are difficult to photograph.

            "Tottenham striker Harry Kane capped off an 'unreal' season as he beat off stiff competition to land the Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year 2015 on Sunday. Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season despite starting the campaign as third-choice striker, netting 30 goals in all competitions for the club while also scoring on his senior England debut. It's been a memorable breakthrough year for Kane, who spent time on loan at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City before breaking into the Spurs first-team under boss Mauricio Pochettino. Harry Kane capped off an 'unreal' season to land the PFA Young Player of the Year 2015 on Sunday . Kane has scored 20 Premier League goals for Tottenham this year in a dream breakthrough season . The 21-year-old arrived on Sunday having also been shortlisted for the PFA Player of the Year award . Tottenham striker Kane arrived at the PFA Awards on Sunday with childhood sweetheart Katie Goodland . Kane will be remembered by Tottenham fans after scoring a match-winning brace in the 2-1 win over Arsenal . PFA Player of the Year: Eden Hazard . PFA Merit award: Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard . PFA Premier League Team of the Year . PFA Championship Team of the Year . PFA League One Team of the Year . PFA League Two Team of the Year . PFA Women's Player of the Year: Ji So-yun . PFA Women's Young Player of the Year: Leah Williamson . The Tottenham striker was congratulated on social media, with the likes of Gary Lineker and Spurs taking to Twitter to show their support. Kane came through the White Hart Lane club's youth ranks and he made his Premier League debut for Spurs during the 2012-13 season but it wasn't until this season that he broke into the first-team. He struck a free-kick winner from the bench at Aston Villa in early November and was then given a run of games by Mauricio Pochettino, with fellow frontmen Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor failing to deliver. And he has not looked back since. 'It is amazing. It is a very proud moment for myself and my family - hopefully the first of many to come,' Kane said of his award. 'I have got to keep working hard, but to be recognised by your fellow players is something special and it is a night I wont forget. It is incredible, an incredible feeling. 'It is amazing. It is a very proud moment for myself and my family - hopefully the first of many to come,' Kane said of his award. 'I have got to keep working hard, but to be recognised by your fellow players is something special and it is a night I wont forget. Kane tweeted before the ceremony: 'All set for the big night, big thanks to @paulsmithdesign for the suit!' In what has been a memorable breakthrough season, Kane also scored on his senior England debut . The England international also scored a brace in Tottenham's 5-3 victory against Chelsea on New Year's Day . The Tottenham striker was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year on Sunday . 2 - Player of the Month awards won back-to-back by Kane, making him only the fourth player to do so in the Premier League. 3 - He scored his first Spurs hat-trick in the Europa League in 2014, and even finished the game in goal after a red card for Hugo Lloris. 4 - Kane spent spells on loan at four different clubs before making his mark at White Hart Lane: Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester. 6 - The striker had scored just six goals for Tottenham before a remarkable 2014-15 campaign. 8 - The age Kane was when he spent a year with the Arsenal academy. 20 - The number of goals hit by Kane in the Premier League alone so far this season. 21 - His age when he made his senior debut for England. 49 - Despite making this number of appearances this season, Kane wants to represent England in the Under-21 European Championships this summer. 79 - The number of seconds it took Kane to score in an England shirt after coming off the bench for a debut against Lithuania. 2015 - Kane has scored 16 goals since the turn of the year. 'It is incredible, an incredible feeling.' Asked to sum up his season in one word, Kane went for: 'Unreal.' Never doubting himself, had he been told 12 months ago this was his destiny, Kane said: 'I'd have said let's do it - let's get it on. 'A lot has changed since then but I have always believed in my ability and have been waiting for a chance to express myself. I didn't think it would go as quickly as it has done but I have managed to ride the wave and the season has got better and better. 'I got the opportunity with the gaffer and I have really enjoyed my season so far - I have taken my chance and this is why we are here.' Kane has been the shining light of the Tottenham side, and said: 'We have worked hard and I have worked hard to get to where we are now. It is going great and hopefully it is the start with more to come.' His stand-out occasion of the season came not in a Tottenham shirt, but when Roy Hodgson ushered him into the England side, Kane scoring after 79 seconds of his debut off the bench against Lithuania on March 27, in a European Championship qualifier. Asked for his favourite moment, Kane said: 'Making my England debut and getting that goal - it was a very proud moment. It made it even more special. 'For a footballer, to represent their country is the pinnacle, and I'm very proud. I was able to do that and it was a moment I won't forget.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino tipped the Chingford-born forward for even bigger things after he scored in the recent 3-1 win at Newcastle, to become the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to reach 30 club goals in a season. Kane beat off stiff competition from Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (pictured) to win the award . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) was joined by team-mate Philippe Coutinho at the awards bash . Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, currently on loan at Manchester City, attended with fiancee Christine Bleakley . 'He has big potential,' the Argentinian said. 'He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' Kane captained the north London outfit for the first time in a goalless draw at Burnley earlier this month. He also helped Pochettino's side reach the Capital One Cup final, where they lost 2-0 to Chelsea. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has tipped Kane for bigger things, saying 'he has big potential'\n",

            "Damon Albarn said modern pop stars are part of a 'selfie generation' that just sings about platitudes . He was once the driving force behind Britpop in the 1990s and became known for his very public spat with Oasis' Gallagher brothers. And now Blur frontman Damon Albarn, who lives in Kensington and Chelsea in London, has returned to pick a fight with even more people in the music industry. Albarn has criticised today's pop stars for 'talking platitudes' and singing only about themselves, at a time when, he believes, they could be using their music to make political statements in the run up to the general election. The 47-year-old dubbed modern pop artists as existing in a 'selfie generation' of stars who use their music to reveal only how they feel. 'Modern day musicians are talking platitudes now and it's not interesting to me,' Albarn told the Sunday Times' Culture magazine. His comments are timely as Blur releases its first album in years this month. Albarn's criticisms are also likely to resonate with people who have been scornful about the work of modern day pop stars such as Taylor Swift and Sam Smith who are known for using their singles to express their emotions about failed relationships. 'What are any of them saying?' added Albarn, now a father-of-one. 'I don't hear them saying anything other than \"This is me and this is how I feel,\" which is an important part of songwriting, but we're talking in the context of an election.' Blur shot to success with Parklife in 1995 - widely seen as a commentary about growing up in the 1990s and the ordinary people that many forgot about. They became one of the best known bands in pop, fuelled by a very public row with rivals Oasis. But by 2002 Graham Coxon - best friend of Albarn - was asked to leave the band and they all began to do their own projects. In 2009 they reunited to play Hyde Park and again in 2012. Sam Smith,recently credited the man who broke his heart for inspiring his award winning album . Taylor Swift is known for using her music to criticise her ex-boyfriends and reveal her struggles in love . Albarn said he would like to see popstars talking about what is going on around them and using their music to comment on modern society and politics. He is characteristically forthright about his own political stance. The Blur frontman longs to see a Labour and Green party government, and dismisses an incident in the 1990s when Tony Blair tried to recruit him as an incident when he was young and new to politics, and still did not know his own political mind. He would also like to see Trident significantly reduced. Alex James (left), Dave Rowntree (centre, top), guitarist Graham Coxon (right) and Damon Albarn (centre front) were one of the best known boybands in the 1990s and have reunited to produced a new album . Blur release their new album The Magic Whip later this month. It is the first time since the 1999 album, entitled 13, that Graham Coxon will feature fully on the album. Magic Whip was created in two sections - the first after they reunited to play in Hyde Park in 2009 and went on a world tour - finding time in Hong Kong to come up with some new material. Coxon worked on the songs and they returned to Hong Kong again to complete the album.\n",

            "Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has revealed he wants to take up a career in motorsport when his playing days are over. Carrick has enjoyed a renaissance this season as Louis van Gaal's side put their stuttering start to the season behind them and carved out a place in the Champions League places. The former West Ham and Tottenham star, now 34, is not planning to hang up his boots any time soon, but when he does he says he'd like to try his hand behind the wheel of an F1 car. Michael Carrick celebrates after Manchester United score, and hopes to be playing for many more years . Carrick revealed that, when he finally hangs up his boots, he wants to try his hand at Formula One . He told MUTV: 'I wouldn't swap football for anything... except maybe to be an F1 driver. 'I'd love to have a go. I love the sport, I'm a massive fan. I've done a few track days and enjoyed that, but there's nothing like going to watch F1. I'm hooked on it. 'Football is work and it's a lot more than that too. But it's about getting balance in your life as you get older. 'At 33 or 34, that's when you're not sure how your body is going to react. 'Living right and trying to look after myself gives me a better chance. I feel as good and as a fit as I ever have. 'I'm not saying I can last as long as Giggsy (Ryan Giggs). Not many people, if anyone, can do what he did. But I tried to learn off Giggsy, Scholesy (Paul Scholes) and Gaz Nev (Gary Neville). Carrick talks to United assistant Ryan Giggs, and says he wants to emulate the legend's longevity . Carrick applauds the Old Trafford fans, as he tries to find ways to keep at the top of his game, despite his age . 'It's stuff in the gym, yoga, living right, eating right... it all comes together and hopefully gives you a chance of playing for that extra couple of years.' The 34-year-old midfielder, who started his professional career at West Ham, admits moving to London from his family home in the north east at the age of 15 was one of the biggest challenges he ever faced. 'Moving to London at 15 was a struggle, but the best thing I ever did,' he said. The first three or four months were tough. Carrick (right) moved to West Ham as a 15-year-old, and says it forced him to grow up fast . 'The football was great, but when you were going back [to where you were staying] you didn't have someone there. You didn't have a mobile phone back then, it was a case of going to the phone box [to call home]. 'Things like that now you take for granted but then it was a big deal. But it helped me grow. It shaped me a lot faster than if I'd stayed in Newcastle and been pampered.' Watch Carrick: Life Before United on MUTV (Tuesday 14:00, 21:30, Wednesday 09:30, 18:00).\n",

            "The 11-year-old autistic boy who miraculously survived four nights alone in Victorian bushland has been reunited with his rescuers. Doctors say they are stunned with how healthy Luke Shambrook appeared, considering he had gone without food or water since Good Friday. Sitting up in his hospital bed, the young boy is seen flanked by two people from the search and rescue team who made the dramatic find on Tuesday, just three kilometres from where he went missing at Lake Eildon National Park, northeast of Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was lost for four nights alone in the Victorian bushland and on Wednesday he was reunited with his rescuers at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne . Luke is with his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' she said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.' The 11-year-old autistic boy was found just three kilometres away from where went missing at Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne . A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search . A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.' A desperate search for Luke was mounted after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday. Other rescuers quickly followed, with one wrapping the terrified boy in a foil blanket, before he was gently taken from the bush to where he could receive proper medial attention . It ended on Tuesday when a police helicopter guiding on-ground searchers to Luke's location and captured the moment on dramatic video, . Luke is seen peering out from behind trees before a uniformed police officer him and appears to take his hand to reassure him he was finally safe. Then other rescuers join the scene, with one of them unfolding a foil blanket and wrapping it around the boy's shoulders. Luke's autism and limited speech could mean he never reveals what happened. 'He may have been wandering around lost and clocking up the k's,' Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Rick Nugent told Fairfax Radio on Wednesday. Luke Shambrook has been found alive after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday . He suffered from dehydration and hypothermia but has been reunited with his mother Rachel (pictured left) His parents Tim and Rachel were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance in a stretcher, with his mother giving him a kiss . Luke was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in bushland off Skyline Road, 3km from the campsite . 'I'm not sure we'll ever know.' Mr Nugent on Tuesday said Luke's survival in the cold, wet, rugged terrain was a miracle. SES spokesman Brent Sergeant said the more days that passed during the search for Luke, the harder it became for volunteers. But finding the boy's beanie on Monday and realising he had walked away from water, rather than toward it, lifted their spirits. His doctors are amazed he is in such a good condition considering he was missing without food and water for so long .

            "New York (CNN)Jake Tapper is the next anchor of CNN's Sunday morning political interview program \"State of the Union.\" CNN announced Tapper's promotion on Friday morning. He will take over the program in June; he'll remain the channel's chief Washington correspondent and the anchor of the weekday afternoon newscast \"The Lead.\" Among his peers, Tapper is seen as an authority on politics, something a program like \"State of the Union\" demands. He received rave reviews when he was the interim anchor of ABC's Sunday morning hour \"This Week\" in 2010. \"I couldn't be more excited about this election season and the new platform I will have at CNN to cover it,\" Tapper said in a statement. \"'State Of The Union' has a rich tradition and I hope to not only build on its history but expand the definition of what a Sunday show can be.\" Tapper thanked CNN Worldwide CEO Jeff Zucker \"for the confidence he continues to show in me and to my colleagues at CNN for the incredible support on air and off that I've received since beginning this adventure two years ago.\" Tapper joined CNN from ABC in 2013 to anchor \"The Lead.\" On \"State of the Union,\" he succeeds Candy Crowley, who signed off the program last December. A rotation of fill-in hosts have been anchoring the program this year. Zucker announced Tapper's appointment on the network's editorial conference call on Friday morning. \"I am thrilled that Jake will take on this additional role at such a pivotal time in the election cycle,\" Zucker said in a statement. \"He has the perfect combination of skills that make him uniquely qualified -- he's a relentless reporter, a gifted storyteller, and a terrific interviewer who doesn't stop until he gets answers. We are lucky to have him on both 'The Lead' and 'State of the Union.'\" Sunday political programs are among the most prestigious chairs at television networks. And changes are afoot: CBS is about to say goodbye to Bob Schieffer, the longtime moderator of \"Face the Nation,\" who will be succeeded by John Dickerson in June. Additionally, NBC replaced David Gregory with Chuck Todd on the original Sunday public affairs program, \"Meet the Press,\" last fall. With the anchor moves at the other networks, CNN may see an opportunity for what's known in the industry as share-shifting -- viewers switching networks and sampling the new anchors.

Substitutes not used: Dominic Kurasik (GK); Tom Adeloye . Scorer: Shenton 8 . Referee: Anthony Da Costa . Attendance: 2,674 . Wilshere has been out of action since suffering the injury in the 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United on November 22 but is finally nearing full fitness. It has been the latest in a succession of injury problems that have hampered his development into the world class player he was expected to become for club and country. Having made a return to action in a reserve friendly with Brentford last week, this was a step up in quality for Wilshere and he exerted a quiet influence without taking a hold on the game. He saw a free-kick 25 yards from goal deflected just over the crossbar early on and initiated a move later in the first-half that culminated in Serge Gnabry firing a snapshot on the turn that was saved the legs of Stoke goalkeeper Daniel Gyollai. Wilshere might have capped his night with a goal but his improvised volley from a Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill cross was saved before Stephy Mavididi slammed home the rebound for Arsenal’s third on 73 minutes. Arteta, who has been on the sidelines since the Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund on November 26, captained the team but failed to make much of an impact during his hour of involvement. Diaby, whose never-ending succession of injuries has seen him absent for an astonishing 226 weeks of his Arsenal career, was arguably their most influential performer as he fights for a new contract. Mikel Arteta was among the players as he stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury . Wilshere runs with the ball during the U21 Premier League match on Tuesday night at the Emirates . With his runs through the centre of midfield, Diaby caused plenty of problems for the Stoke defence and he had two opportunities to get on the scoresheet in his 70 minutes of action. On 17 minutes, a lovely through ball from Gnabry set him clear inside the box but a last-ditch tackle ruined everything and, shortly afterwards, he curled a shot a fraction over the bar from the edge of the area. With the first-teamers mis-firing, it was left to Alex Iwobi to make an impression with two clinical first-half goals that were almost identical and a stoppage time third. On 23 minutes, Iwobi, who is capped for England’s youth teams but likely to play for Nigeria, surged at the Stoke defence, beat two men and fired crisply across the keeper and into the far corner. And he repeated the trick five minutes before the break, locating the same corner from pretty much the same position after latching on to Diaby’s slide-rule pass. Abou Diaby of Arsenal pictured shooting during the match between Arsenal U21 and Stoke City U21 . England midfielder Wilshere came through the 4-1 win over Stoke unscathed on Tuesday night . Arsenal had started on the back foot and fell behind eight minutes in when the highly-rated Ollie Shenton was gifted the simplest of close-range finishes when goalkeeper Deyan Iliev fumbled a cross from Nathan Ricketts-Hopkinson. But by the time Iwobi completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, Arsenal were in complete control. It was the best of the young striker’s treble as he burst forward at lightning pace and delicately lifted the ball over the keeper. When Arsenal’s senior side have been a First Division team for a century, it seems incongruous to find the under 21s stuck in the second division. But that could soon be rectified. This win kept them in touch with the leading pack and Arsenal retain games in hand on all above them as they seek to claim one of the two promotion places to the top division.\n",

            "Unleashing your inner Shakespeare could be just a few jolts of electricity away. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent. They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current on the brain's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent . As well as creativity, these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression. Flavio Frohlich, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina said: 'If we could enhance these brain activity patterns, then we could potentially help many people.' Alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 Hertz 9 (or cycles per second). They were discovered in 1929 by Hans Berger, who invented EEG. Alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli – things we see, feel, taste, smell, and hear. When alpha oscillations are active, your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream, meditate, or conjure ideas. When you come fully online, alpha oscillations disappear. Other oscillations at higher frequencies, such as gamma oscillations, take over. An EEG of a naturally occurring alpha oscillation in a human brain. Enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression, scientists claim . They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. They then recorded the results using EEG . Knowing this, other researchers began associating alpha oscillations with creativity. Professor Frohlich set out to find evidence. His idea was simple. If he could enhance the rhythmic patterns of alpha oscillations to improve creativity. For the study, Professor Frohlich's team enrolled 20 healthy adults. Researchers placed electrodes on each side of each participant's frontal scalp and a third electrode toward the back of the scalp. An experimental technique used to boost brain performance with electrical pulses can actually cause people to perform less well in some tasks, scientists have found. The technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation, is already being marketed in commercial products as a way of helping computer game players and athletes improve their focus. However, new research from the University of Oxford suggests that the benefits of this technique, which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current, may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task. They found that while electrical stimulation helped those who lacked confidence or were anxious about performing a series of sums, it caused those who did not fear mathematics to decline. A follow up study that examined how volunteers fared at spotting which way an arrow was pointing on a screen when confronted with distracting information showed that all those who received stimulation performed more poorly. This way, the 10-Hertz alpha oscillation stimulation for each side of the cortex would be in unison. Each participant underwent two sessions. During one session, researchers used a 10-Hertz sham stimulation for just five minutes. Participants felt a tingle at the start of the five minutes. For the next 25 minutes, each participant continued to take the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. In one task, each participant was shown a small fraction of an illustration – sometimes just a bent line on a piece of paper. Participants used the line to complete an illustration, and they wrote a title when they finished. In the other session each participant underwent the same protocol, except they were stimulated at 10 Hertz for the entire 30 minutes while doing the Torrance test. The tingling sensation only occurred at the start of the stimulation, ensuring that each participant did not know which session was the control session. Then Frohlich's team compared each participant's creativity score, they found participants scored an average 7.4 percentage points higher than they did during the control sessions. 'That's a pretty big difference when it comes to creativity,' Frohlich said. 'Several participants showed incredible improvements in creativity. It was a very clear effect.' 'We don't know if there are long-term safety concerns,' he said. 'We did a well-controlled, one-time study and found an acute effect.' 'Also, I have strong ethical concerns about cognitive enhancement for healthy adults, just as sports fans might have concerns about athletic enhancement through the use of performance-enhancing drugs.'\n",

            "Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet to the head nearly two months after going missing in may 2014 . Nearly a year after North Dakota college student Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet in the head, his mother still struggles with how her shy son who liked to bowl and belonged to a club of electricity enthusiasts got mixed up in the dangerous world of illegal drugs. Tammy Sadek believes the answer is that her 20-year-old son signed his own death warrant when he agreed to become a confidential informant for police after they caught him selling marijuana. Authorities say he knew what he was getting into and agreed to help them of his own free will. Still, people who knew Sadek are shocked by what happened. 'He was a gentle soul,' said Kristi Brandt, principal of Valley City High School, from which Sadek graduated. Investigators haven't concluded whether Sadek was slain or killed himself. Adding to the mystery, a gun that fires the same caliber bullet that killed Sadek is missing from their family farm near the tiny town of Rogers. An autopsy concluded that Sadek died of the gunshot wound, and that he had no drugs or alcohol in his system. How his body ended up in the Red River has not been explained and no gun was found. An investigative report from two-and-half months ago said the drug task force which recruited Sadek acted appropriately. But his death is raising questions about the use of young, low-level drug offenders as confidential informants and if they should they be given more detailed information about the dangers. Sadek had been working with a drug task force as a confidential informant after he was caught selling marijuana on campus in 2013.  His mother, Tammy Sadek believes that he signed his death warrant when he began working for the force . The circumstances surrounding the death of Sadek, who was a second-year student at the State College of Science, still remain unknown . American Civil Liberties Union spokeswoman Jennifer Cook said informants are doing a dangerous part of law enforcement, without the training. 'The safety risks associated with informant use can far outweigh the benefits,' she said. Sadek was a second-year electrical technician student at the State College of Science, a two-year community college in the southeastern North Dakota city of Wahpeton where about 3,600 students study everything from diesel technology to performing arts. He enjoyed lake activities and golfing in addition to bowling and electrical work while growing up on the family farm. Brandt said Sadek was never a troublemaker in high school, and was always polite and respectful of authority. She doubted his nature changed much in college. 'Sometimes there are changes, but usually it's more on the level of a maturity change, not necessarily a personality change,' she said. He wanted an electrical technician master's degree, but his plans began to go awry in April 2013 when he twice sold marijuana to a confidential informant. Both transactions were small - for a total of $80 worth of drugs - but they took place on campus, making them serious felonies. In November 2013, agents with the Southeast Multi-County Agency Drug Task Force searched Sadek's dorm room and said they found a grinder containing marijuana residue. Though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in Sadek's death, his mother Tammy believes he would not have killed himself . The next day, Sadek - facing the prospect of drug charges that could land him in prison for 41 years - completed paperwork to become a confidential informant. The attraction of cooperating with authorities is that it offers the chance to keep a felony off the record of a young person, said Wahpeton Police Chief Scott Thorsteinson. Richland County Deputy Sheriff Jason Weber, now the interim task force supervisor, won't say whether Sadek was specifically told of the dangerous nature of the work he would be doing. The document that Sadek signed to become a confidential informant did not explicitly state the potential risks. Drug investigators need to be more explicit about those dangers, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project. 'You have to really say, \"This is the risk: You're entering a world that's dangerous, and you might end up dead,\"' Harrington said. Sadek bought drugs three times for the regional task force over the next three months, one short of the four purchases required of him. Officials have said that confidential drug informants, who are often young and low-level drug offenders, need to be more educated of the dangers that come with the job . A security camera videotaped Sadek leaving his dormitory early on May 1, 2014. He wasn't seen again. His body was found in the river about two months later. Authorities estimate that he had died two days after he disappeared. Officials with the North and South Dakota state crime bureaus and a Cass County sheriff's detective reviewed the task force's involvement with Sadek and said in their late January report that they 'did not see anything that caused concern.' 'That's how drug task forces work all over the world,' said Weber, the task force supervisor. 'You're always constantly trying to find the bigger person and go to that person's supplier.' But Tammy Sadek believes that even though the probe was billed as independent, members of the law enforcement community 'have each other's back'. She has a point, according to John Burton, a California attorney and vice president of the National Police Accountability Project. Colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants, while Sadek's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son . 'It's just a charade when they do these things,' Burton said of law enforcement agencies investigating one another. U.S. Justice Department guidelines state that authorities should consider the risk of harm to a potential l informant, but do not say that the person should be informed of the risks. North Dakota Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Liz Brocker declined to comment on any policies or procedures that might be in place for drug task forces in the state. Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School professor Alexandra Natapoff said the use of criminal informants 'is almost entirely unregulated' across the country, though that is beginning to change. The Florida Legislature in 2009 passed 'Rachel's Law,' requiring police to adopt policies to protect informants, after 23-year-old Rachel Hoffman was shot to death in 2008 while working as an informant. That law is 'only the beginning of the protections that we need for young, vulnerable informants,' Natapoff said. Tammy Sadek believes her son was scared into becoming a confidential informant. She's started a Justice for Andrew Sadek Facebook page that has more than 3,200 likes. 'I would like to see (task forces) stop using kids,' she said. 'I know it's common, but these are just little fish.'\n",

            "Alan Pardew will target a marquee signing this summer so his Crystal Palace side are taken seriously next season. Pardew has transformed Palace into relegation candidates to a club pushing for a top-half finish since taking charge in January. He will be active in the transfer market come the end of the season in an attempt to take the club to the next level and is keen to bring in a big name to declare the club’s intentions. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is keen on bringing in a star name to boost the club's profile . Eagles boss Pardew slapped a '40 to 60 million pounds' price-tag on Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie . ‘That is a solution to not just give us a better media standing than we have, but to also give everybody else here the recognition in terms of their value that we could attract a player of that type,’ Pardew said. ‘That is something I have thought about.’ Pardew is prepared to let star winger Yannick Bolasie leave for ‘between 40 and 60 million pounds’ and would use the money to build a formidable squad. But even if that does not happen, Pardew, whose side host relegation strugglers Hull City on Saturday, is adamant that he will be backed by chairman Steve Parish. The former Newcastle boss was able to make five permanent signings in January and will look to add several more when the transfer window re-opens. Pardew added: ’To be honest, the chairman is as much banging on my door as I am his. The most important thing is we get good value.’ While Palace may seek to break the £7million club transfer record set with the September 2014 arrival of James McArthur from Wigan, Pardew is loath to do so lightly. Palace broke their club transfer record in September 2014 when they splashed out £7m on James McArthur . 'It isn't just about the money and isn't just about the figure that you pay,' said Pardew. 'It really is about are they better than what you have. 'Therefore what is their value? And that is what you have to gauge. 'I have to say this club has done very well in the transfer market prior to me coming in. I think in that window just passed we bought really well, but really we haven't seen them. 'I haven't had to lean on Shola Ameobi, Jordon Mutch, Chungy (Lee Chung-yong) too much really. 'And I really did think, particularly in Shola, that he was going to be a massive player for us if it got close. 'In a way the team have taken that equation away.' Pardew has guided Palace out of the relegation mire since his January arrival, with the Eagles fifth in the Premier League standings on 2015's fixtures alone. Victory over Hull in Saturday's Selhurst Park clash would rubber-stamp Palace's top-flight safety, and Pardew admitted he is eager to make what experiments he can with next term in mind. 'There could be an opportunity to look for next year and that is what I am going to do between now and the end of the year,' he said. 'I will try and keep our professionalism together, but also look at Chungy and Jordon Mutch and how they are going to impact on what is a good team at the moment. 'We still have some big games though, so I have to look at that and can't be experimenting in some. 'It is about making sure whatever team goes out there is every bit as good as the team that has played in the last few weeks.' Pardew has not had to 'lean on' Shola Ameobi, Jordon Mutch and Lee Chung-yong since their arrival .\n",

            "Caretakers of Abraham Lincoln's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in National Geographic magazine and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site, even as they commemorate the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Civil War president's assassination. For the state that calls itself the 'Land of Lincoln,' the timing of a ceremony Wednesday in Springfield to mark his death is awkward because Illinois faces a financial crisis and Gov. Bruce Rauner has proposed eliminating the state Historic Preservation Agency that manages sites including the tomb as it currently exists. He would roll the agency into another department. What's more, the popular tourist site was pilloried in this month's issue of National Geographic magazine as having 'all the historical character of an office lobby.' Landmark: In this Feb. 12, 2015 file photo, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner participates in ceremonies honoring President Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln tomb in Springfield, Illinois . Leader: A marker is seen over the burial site of Abraham Lincoln inside Lincoln's tomb within Oak Ridge Cemetery (November 2013 file photo) Killing: President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at a performance of the play 'Our American Cousin' in April 1865 . Recounting the route of Lincoln's funeral train to Springfield for burial, historian Adam Goodheart describes the tomb as 'a disappointment' and reconstructed in 'incongruous Art Deco style.' 'It's strange to think that there is a place where Lincoln still physically exists in the world, let alone that it's a place like this,' writes Goodheart, who is director for Washington College's Center for the American Experience in Maryland. Goodheart's publicist didn't immediately return a request for comment. The hours and days the Lincoln tomb is open have been reduced, and it's staffed with fewer employees since state lawmakers last year cut $1.1 million funding for sites in the Springfield area. On Tuesday — the 150th anniversary of John Wilkes Booth's shooting of Lincoln, although the president was pronounced dead the following day — Joan Boatz and a group of former bridge club friends found the tomb's iron door locked, despite a sign saying the site should be open at that time. Chris Wills, spokesman for the Historic Preservation Agency, said the correct times when the site is open are posted on its website. Pam VanAlstine, president of the Lincoln Monument Association, said she's deeply concerned about what more cuts might mean for the Lincoln site. 'We're all scared to death,' said VanAlstine, who also serves as a volunteer tour guide. 'We don't know how things are going to be run.' She and other supporters of how Lincoln's final resting place is presented to the public said the National Geographic portrayal was unfair. Remembered: Tourists walk out of Abraham Lincoln's tomb and past a bust of Lincoln statue (November 2013 file photo) Shrouded in history: Caretakers of Abraham Lincoln's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in National Geographic magazine and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site (February 2014 file photo) 'The author of the piece is certainly entitled to feel underwhelmed by the tomb's interior, but I think it's safe to say he's in the minority,' Wills said. According to the State Historic Preservation Agency, the tomb and its receiving vault have seen more than $2.5 million in recent repairs and renovations, leaving it in what Wills describes as 'excellent physical condition.' The tomb's interior plaster and paint, and bronze and marble construction were renovated last year, and its interior lighting was upgraded for approximately $730,000. The state is currently working on waterproofing the receiving vault, repairing the stone structure's interior, and landscaping to direct water away from the vault, a roughly $390,000 project. Lincoln's tomb was designed by Vermont sculptor Larkin Mead, who won a national contest. It was dedicated by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874. Originally built on what historians describe as an 'inadequate foundation,' it was reconstructed first in 1899, and then again in 1930 to give the public access to the interior burial chamber. Today, the tomb, a circular structure topped with an obelisk, has its interior sheathed in alternating black and tan marble and is trimmed with bronze. Hallways stretch on either side of a rotunda to the family burial chamber, where Lincoln lies below an inscription 'Now He belongs to the ages.' William Sparks, a visitor to the outside of the tomb Tuesday who took an Amtrak train from Green Bay, Wisconsin, said he had a copy of the National Geographic story with him at his Springfield hotel, but disagreed with its conclusion. 'It's absolutely gorgeous,' he said of the site, even though he didn't get to see the interior of the tomb. 'I don't get (the author's take) at all. This is very impressive.'

            "Manchester United have confirmed their plans to revisit the USA on pre-season this summer after agreeing to Louis van Gaal’s desire to head to America rather than Asia. United’s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions’ Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal’s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer’s tournament around United’s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer’s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer’s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven’t visited since David Moyes’ pre-season of 2013. Ander Herrera, David De Gea and Juan Mata (left to right) hold the trophy after beating Liverpool in Miami . The squad reached the final of the 2014 International Champions Cup, but had travelled about 13,500 miles . July 24 - Manchester United 7-0 LA Galaxy (Pasadena) Attendance: 86,432 .

            "Just days before convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan is set to face death by firing squad, reports have emerged that he has married his girlfriend of three years, Febyanti Herewila. According to a family friend of Chan's, the pair wed inside the chapel at Besi Prison on Nusakambangan Island on Monday with immediate family present. This comes just months after the Bali Nine ringleader proposed to his girlfriend while he was still at Kerobokan Prison in February. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan (left, pictured with Myuran Sukumaran) has married his fiance Febyanti Herewila at Besi Prison on Nusakambangan Island . Febyanti, known as Feby, is pictured here on Sunday before her visit to the island where Chan is being held . According to Chan's family the pair wed inside the chapel at Besi Prison on Nusakambangan Island on Monday . Febyanti (left) with Chan's brother Michael (right) accepted her now husband's marriage proposal in February . Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo. Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair. The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister. Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day. Salvation Army minister and family friend David Soper officiated the wedding. Mr Soper has also been asked by Chan to be his religious adviser in his final hours and witness his execution. Fairfax Media report that when Attorney General H.M. Prasetyo first heard Chan's request to get married, he thought it was a joke. 'There was a wish from Andrew Chan, which I thought wasn't serious and wasn't the last wish, but it turned out to be serious. He wanted to be tied in matrimony with his girlfriend,' Mr Prasetyo told detik.com. 'He's been in isolation so I thought he wasn't serious.' On Sunday Chan's final wish to spend his last days at church with his family was granted. Indonesian lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis displays a self-portrait painting made by Australian drug convict and death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran, entitled 'the second last day' Andrew Chan's mother Helen (centre) is seen here with the pair's Australian lawyer Julian McMahon (right) on Sunday . Michael Chan, brother to Andrew, arrives at the port authority office at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap, Central Java on Monday . Sukumaran's sister Brintha (centre) also look distraught ahead of her journey to visit her brother for what could be one of the last times . This week Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were served their execution notices and are set to be executed at the stroke of midnight on Wednesday (3am AEST). Sukumaran has requested to spend his last days before his execution painting for as long as possible, and has vowed to stare down executioners when he's dragged into the jungle. He has painted a series of haunting self-portraits over the past few days, with titles such as 'The Second Last Day' and '72 hrs just started'. They show him looking distraught, while one particularly harrowing artwork has a gaping hole in Sukumaran's heart. Meantime fellow drug smuggler Andrew Chan hopes to spend his last moments at church with his family. Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji visited her son on 'death island' on Monday ahead of his planned execution on Wednesday morning . With her was her other son Chintu, Myuran's brother . Lawyer Julian McMahon escorted the families of the two Bali Nine drug smugglers to see the pair . There were devastating scenes at Nusakambangan on Monday, as the pair's family and lawyer Julian McMahon visited the death row inmates. Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants during official proceedings on Saturday, saying they believed it would be unjust to kill them. Chan and Sukumaran, convicted in 2005 for their role in a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia, were given the official 72 hours notice on Saturday. Families of both the men visited them in prison on Monday, and were told they will have to say their final goodbyes on Tuesday. Andrew Chan's mother was in tears as she boarded a ferry to 'death island' with the Bali Nine pair's Australian lawyer Julian McMahon. Sukumaran's sister Brintha also look distraught ahead of her journey to visit her brother for what could be one of the last times.\n",

            "Raheem Sterling's controversial 'It's-Not-About-The-Money' campaign led him to the Emirates Stadium, where Liverpool and Arsenal fans united to protest against the rising price of football for travelling fans. '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket' read one banner, held across the home and away fans before kick-off. Hopefully the irony wasn't lost on Sterling, even if it did not interfere with his football. It was a difficult afternoon for Raheem Sterling, who toiled as Arsenal surged to victory over Liverpool . Sterling (centre) is crowded out by Arsenal players as he struggled to impose himself on the game . Sterling was brought down by Hector Bellerin for Liverpool's penalty, which was only a consolation . Sterling tussles with Per Mertersacker (left) and struggled to repeatedly threaten Arsenal's defence . Crowd reaction: . Quite indifferent. A few jeers from the Arsenal fans now and then, but nothing serious. They wouldn't want to put him off. After all, he's flattered by the interest. No notable dissent from Liverpool fans, away in the far corner. They joined his appeals for a penalty when he had been nudged over by Hector Bellerin. Body Language: . Good. Bright and busy. Energetic, showed willingly for the ball and didn't shirk the physical battle with Per Mertesacker in the first half. Keen to pick up the ball and run in the second half. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers looks on as Sterling watches the play unfold . Sterling was positioned in an advanced role for Liverpool, a position he admits he prefers playing . Sterling looks dejected as Liverpool were comfortably beaten by Arsenal in the Premier League . Position: . Started up front where he likes it (and not at wing-back where it seems he doesn’t) because Daniel Sturridge was only fit enough for the bench after the hip injury which ruled him out of England duty. Jordan Henderson deputised at right-wing-back. Sturridge came on to replace Lazar Markovic at the break, with Liverpool three down. Sterling dropped to be one of the support strikers, from the left. Mertesacker (right) puts in a challenge on Sterling in the early Saturday game in the Premier League . Sterling (left) is challenged by Arsenal's attacking midfielder Mesut Ozil in the game at The Emirates . Form: . Early tackle from Laurent Koscielny which left him on his back, holding his foot. Slid one shot wide form edge of box. Unable to reach a pass from Markovic when Markovic should have taken on the shot. More involved after the break when he switched to the left wing and Liverpool threw caution to the wind. Really came to life in the last 20 minutes, winning the penalty scored by Henderson, 15 minutes from time, when fouled by Bellerin. Sterling (right) takes the ball beyond Arsenal midfield player Aaron Ramsey at The Emirates . Sterling (centre) is blocked off by Bellerin of Arsenal, who scored the opener after 37 minutes . Interaction . Limited. Played up front alone. Nothing much to celebrate. Hugs and handshakes after the match for a few Arsenal players but not with his team-mates. Joined his team-mates when they trudged over to applaud the fans at the end and left the pitch in conversation with Sturridge. Sterling (right) shares a joke with Daniel Sturridge in the warm-up before the game against Arsenal . Sterlign (right) gets a delivery into the penalty area as Bellerin attempts to block . Sterling (right) trudges off of the pitch after being humbled by Arsenal in a 4-1 loss at The Emirates . Verdict: . Among Liverpool’s better players, but unable to seize the game and produce the sort of performance that would enhance his negotiating stance and convince the world he belongs at the very top.\n",

            "Nicola Sturgeon tonight warned Ed Miliband he will not be able to pass a Labour Budget unless he agrees to SNP demands - despite the Labour leader's claim that he would not do any deals. The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament. Mr Miliband tonight ruled out a formal deal with the resurgent Nationalists, but a vote-by-vote arrangement remains on the table. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon faced questions from a studio audience at BBC Scotland in Glasgow this evening - immediately after the three main Westminster party leaders faced off in Leeds . Miss Sturgeon's comments came just days after her predecessor Alex Salmond was caught boasting: 'I'm writing Labour's Budget.' The SNP wants to end the Tory-Lib Dem austerity programme and delay plans to balance Britain's books by spending an extra £140billion over the lifetime of the next parliament. Miss Sturgeon believes the coalition's fixed term parliaments legislation will strengthen the SNP's hand. It means general elections are held on a fixed timetable every five years, and makes it much harder for an election to happen at other times. Two-thirds of MPs now have to back an earlier election, and governments can lose votes on Budgets, Queen's Speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election. '[Mr Miliband] will not be able to get policies through without winning support from other parties,' she said last night in a Question Time-style programme on BBC Scotland. 'He won't get his Budget through unless he compromises.' The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament . Ms Sturgeon's remarks come after the former home secretary David Blunkett admitted that Labour could not win a majority because of the SNP surge in Scotland. He said: 'We have a situation where Labour could win literally scores of seats in England and Wales and see themselves unable to offer a majority Labour government because of what's happened in just one part of the United Kingdom.' Mr Miliband tonight insisted he would not do any deals with the SNP - and claimed he would rather not form a government than team up with Ms Sturgeon's party. The Labour leader's hopes of outright victory on May 7 have been shattered by an extraordinary surge in support for the SNP since the referendum in September saw Scots reject independence. Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking in tonight's special BBC Question Time, said he would rather not be Prime Minister than make a deal with the SNP . David Cameron, appearing on the special BBC programme first, said he only needed 23 seats to win a majority . Ms Sturgeon, who replaced Alex Salmond after the No vote, has vowed to use her gains in the election to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour administration. An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News found support for the nationalists at 54 per cent while Scottish Labour had slipped to 20 per cent. Mr Miliband sought to dismiss the idea that he would be propped up by the SNP: 'We are not going to do a deal with the Scottish National Party. 'If it meant we would not be in government. then so be it. I'm not going to give in to SNP demands - whether that is on Trident or on the deficit. We do want to put forward a Labour Queen's speech.' But Ms Sturgeon said: 'If we have a big team of SNP MPs we can exercise real clout on behalf of Scotland, but we can also build alliances with others in other parts of the UK to get more progressive policies because I think Westminster needs shaken up for everybody.' She added: 'In the House of Commons now… you can defeat governments, you can change the direction of governments without bringing governments down. 'That gives the opposition parties enormous clout. 'Now I know that David Cameron and Ed Miliband are clinging to the pretence that one of the other of them is going to get a majority, but all the polls say – and everybody else knows – they're not. 'And after the votes are counted, they're frankly going to have to wake up and smell the coffee and respect the outcome of the election.' David Cameron faced a series of tough questions from the Yorkshire audience at the BBC Question Time programme hosted by David Dimbleby (left) Labour leader Ed Miliband faced a series of brutal questions over Labour's economic record - but insisted the party had not spent too much . The SNP has declared it will never support the Conservatives in a hung Parliament, but is ready to do a deal with Labour, even if it finishes in second place. It would be the first time since 1924 that a second-placed party had formed a government. Earlier this month, secret video footage of Mr Salmond raised new fears about the Nationalists holding the balance of power at Westminster after May 7. At a fundraising event in the Highlands filmed on April 13, Mr Salmond, who is bidding to return to the Commons, is heard mocking Labour after Chuka Umunna, Shadow Business Secretary, had slapped down Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and said: 'The leader of the Scottish Labour party will not be in charge of the UK budget.' Mr Salmond joked to the audience: 'But then I knew that already, because I'm writing the Labour party budget.' Mr MIliband has insisted Labour will be writing its own Budget.\n",

            "Wales' crunch Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out. The top two sides in Group B meet at the Cardiff City Stadium on June 12 with Wales in their best position to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden. Belgium and Wales both have 11 points from five games with Marc Wilmots' side - ranked fourth in the world - on top spot because of a superior goal difference. Wales'  Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out . Gareth Bale fires homes a brilliant free-kick during Wales' 3-0 victory over Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying . Real Madrid star Bale celebrates as the victory took Wales to the top of the Group B table on goal difference . But Wales' comprehensive 3-0 victory in Israel last weekend has seen expectations rise that Chris Coleman's charges can claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots and make it all the way to the 2016 finals in France. 'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets,' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website. 'Due to overwhelming demand, general admission tickets for the European qualifiers match between Wales and Belgium at the Cardiff City Stadium have now sold out.' It is understood the Wales squad prefer to play at the Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium . There had been speculation that Wales would play Belgium at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium with so much interest in the match. But that was never going to happen as UEFA rules prevent the venue being changed within 120 days of the scheduled date. It is understood Gareth Bale and company would prefer playing at the more intimate Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium, where they have not played since meeting England in a Euro 2012 qualifier in March 2011.\n",

            "A mother of two who works as a high-class escort has told how she received 'a torrent of abuse from the thinly pursed lips of apparently \"better\" mothers' when she revealed her double life on national television. Amanda Goff, known to her clients as Samantha X, is a former journalist wrote a book about her experience after becoming a global sensation. In her new book, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, the 40-year-old said she was shocked her revelation garnered so much attention from the media, with interview requests flooding in from news organisations all over the world. After being labelled ‘a whore and a s*** and an anti-feminist’, Ms Goff said the most troubling part of her ‘coming out’ experience was the response she received from other mothers, who expected her children to ‘endure a life of misery’ because of her abnormal profession. Scroll down for video . Former journalist Amanda Goff appeared on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X . ‘The fact I had kids caused a torrent of vitriolic abuse spouting from the thinly pursed lips of apparently ‘better’ mothers than me who thought my role in society was awful, tutting my ‘poor, poor’ children and raging about what a terrible, selfish mother I was, and how because of my job, my kids would have to endure a life of misery, bullying and shame (probably from their own kids),’ she wrote. Although Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines, knew her story would one day become ‘old news’, she said she felt physically sick in the weeks following her revelation. After a stern talking to from a close friend, Ms Goff said she decided to ‘toughen up’ and start focusing on the people in her life who she thought really mattered. The mother-of-two said her harshest critics were other mothers concerned with the ‘life of misery’ her children were expected to endure . ‘The people who loved me knew who I was. I adored my kids, and my kids adored me. I was a good person, a good mum, a good friend.’ Ms Goff said she was glad she has been able to tell her story and reveal the ‘emotional turmoil’ and ‘torture’ she faced after she outed herself as an escort. She explained that among the negativity, she also received many messages of 'kindness' and 'support'. Some even told her they were inspired to leave their mundane jobs to pursue a career in the sex industry. Ms Goff claims her job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones . Goff said she is not ashamed of her decision to go public and says she is the 'happiest' she has ever been . ‘They want to thank me for going public and making them realise it was okay to like sex, and want to get paid for it,’ she said. Not only did Ms Goff receive support from those who wanted to follow in her footsteps, she was also commended for her strength and courage by women who already worked in the sex industry. While she copped a lot of flack for admitting she worked in the sex industry, Ms Goff said her job as a sex worker, was more ethical than her former career as a journalist where she was asked to hide in bushes and illegally hack phones. Discussing her personal life, Ms Goff confirmed her ex partner and the father of her children had known about her x-rated career ‘for yonks’ and although he did not support it, she had never deceived him about it. Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha (right) told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity . Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with Mr Basha - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X . Hooked: Amanda Goff reveals why she decided to out herself as a high-class escort and what happened after her big secret became a global sensation . Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha, told Daily Mail Australia last year that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity. He said: 'It's a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what's going on. I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.' After cutting ties with her former flame and coming out as an escort, Ms Goff said Samantha X was inundated with requests and claimed she could have pocketed a ‘million dollars’ if she'd have seen every person who inquired. However, after enduring months of public scrutiny, Ms Goff said her time as an escort was coming to an end. She said that while she would miss the extravagant lifestyle, at this stage in her life, she had become more concerned with finding a long-term partner. ‘Samantha X is afraid of love,’ she revealed. ‘I am sick of being afraid. I am sick of sleeping alone.’ If you want to learn more about Amanda Goff's story you can read about it in her tell all book Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort.\n",

            "Washington (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying he sees better options than \"this bad deal or war.\" \"I think there's a third alternative, and that is standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal,\" Netanyahu told CNN's Jim Acosta Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" His comments come as Democrats and Republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to \"contain himself.\" And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president \"could do better.\" Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it's implemented. \"It does not roll back Iran's nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"That's a very bad deal. \" Netanyahu said Iran is a country of \"congenital cheating\" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama. \"I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful,\" Netanyahu said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu \"would contain himself.\" The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States, as well as Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- are \"on the cusp of something that can be workable.\" \"It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes,\" Feinstein said. \"But I don't think it's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world.\" Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the \"breakout\" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the \"almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal.\" \"We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb,\" he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on \"Face the Nation\" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a \"new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama.\" And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal. \"Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except, maybe, Rand Paul, could do better,\" Graham said.\n",

            "This United States may have been made for you and me, but America's diamond deserts and redwood forests could net a sizable amount of cash if we ever decided to sell it, according to a new study. All the land in the lower 48 states was worth a combined $23trillion in 2009,  combination of tax and real estate data in a paper published by the Commerce Department as revealed. Researchers estimated that land in the country, minus all the buildings, roads and trees on top of it, achieved its peak value of $26.2 trillion in in 2006 before sliding down three trillion dollars in three years. A map of the US by county shows areas with land values from $73,000 to $3.35million per acre in dark blue and land less than $2,000 per acre in white. The entire country is worth $23trillion, according to new study . Prices may have rebounded since the end of the economic recession, but the study from William Larson paints the widest ever picture of how much the ground beneath our feet is actually worth. The research used land prices combined with Census data to tabulate values for all of the federal, agricultural and developed land in the country, excluding Alaska, Hawaii and bodies of water. Washington DC had the greatest land value, with a staggering $1,050,000 per acre. It was followed by New Jersey, where the average acre cost of $196,000 led a foursome of smaller Northeastern states with acre values above $100,000 with Rhode Island's $133,730, Connecticut's $128,820 and Massachusetts $102,210. Land in Washington DC had the highest price  in the entire country, with land costing more than $1million per acre . Northeastern states including New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts all have per acre values above $100,000. Above, a home in Cape May, New Jersey . California was the most valuable state overall at $3.9trillion while Vermont was worth only $44billion. Wyoming, with $1,560 per acre, is the cheapest place in the country to buy land, followed by New Mexico at $1,930 and Nevada at $2,120, according to the Wall Street Journal. Land in large urban areas was the most valuable, with cities of more than 1million people worth $64,844 per acre. Despite only being 5.8 per cent of the country's 1.89billion acres, developed land had a slim majority of the country's value. Besides Washington DC, New Jersey and Rhode Island had the highest percentages of developed land, both more than 30 per cent. Wyoming, which like many Western states is majority-owned by the federal government, had the lowest per acre price at $1,560. Above, the High Plains Desert in Wyoming . The federal government, the largest landowner in the US and the fourth largest in the world, owns 24 per cent of the country and majorities of six states including California, Nevada and Oregon. However, the land is almost entirely undeveloped and is only worth $1.8trillion, which is about 10 percent of the federal debt. The government owns almost none of Connecticut, just 0.1 per cent. True to its reputation for having golden waves of grain, forty-seven per cent of the land in the US is farmland, with the highest state percentage for agriculture being Nebraska's 92.7 per cent. Mr Larson estimated that his figures were within a 10 per cent margin of error. He said he did the study because 'Despite its fundamental role in nearly all economic activity, there is no current and complete estimate of the value of the land area of the United States'.

            "It is usually found in pharmacy aisles beside creams to treat painful skin conditions such as eczema in children. But these days it seems you are just as likely to come across Cetaphil in the beauty cupboards of the rich and famous. It has emerged that the cleanser is responsible for the glowing skin of a host of stars including Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden and actresses Charlize Theron and Olivia Wilde. Scroll down for video . Celebrity favourite: It has emerged that Cetaphil is responsible for the glowing skin of a host of stars including Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden (left) and actresses Charlize Theron (right) and Olivia Wilde . Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, which currently costs £6.74 at Boots and is also stocked in pharmacies such as Lloyds and online on Amazon, is fragrance and soap free and contains just eight ingredients, which makes it less harsh on the skin than other facewashes containing long lists of chemicals. Dermatologistsis developed it for people with highly sensitive skin so it is often favoured by ezcema and psoriasis sufferers. Its formula suits all ages, from babies to mums and the elderly. Fragrance free: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser . And yesterday Miss Holden, 44, revealed that it is her secret to remaining fresh-faced. ‘I swear by Cetaphil. 'It isn’t fancy or expensive but it does what I need it to do,’ she said. The mother of two girls said she had started looking into ways to improve her skin after playing Princess Fiona in Shrek in the West End in 2011, which meant wearing heavy green make-up each night. She said she used to have botox injections and plastic surgery but that nearly dying giving birth to her daughter Hollie in 2012 put her off any more invasive treatments. She now relies on radio frequency energy facials (as well as more budget-friendly products such as Cetaphil) to hold back the years. Rush actress Miss Wilde, 31, has described Cetaphil as ‘the best’ facial cleanser, while Monster star Miss Theron, 39, said she loves the ‘clean smell’. Beauty therapist Joanne Evans, of Dr Jules Nabet’s Medical Rooms in London, said that she has been recommending Cetaphil to clients for years, adding: ‘It’s a very gentle cleanser for sensitive skins… . 'It’s great for breakouts too, dermatologists recommend this as [one of the best] cleansers.’\n",

Surrounded by women: The billionaire businessman appears to spend much of his excessive life in the company of stunning women . Toutouni, who goes by the name @lunatic-living on the site, said: 'What man in this world can't say this isn't the lifestyle they want to live? It's a lifestyle that every man wants to live and I enjoy living it. 'As a single guy, I dated many, many women. Being young in LA and having anything you want, it's not that hard to get any girl you want.' His Instagram account uses  the line: 'They say it is better to be poor and happy than rich and miserable, so I compromised! Moderately rich and just moody.' The billionaire downplays the new rivalry with his friend Dan Bilzerian, who was dubbed King of Instagram last year and has a staggering eight million followers. He said: 'I don't want to compete with Dan but people are saying that I've grown dramatically and extremely fast I can tell you that. 'But Dan is actually a friend of mine and the whole Instagram thing started because he was posting on it. 'I saw that his Instagram following was growing pretty fast so I started doing it.

The previous so-called King of Instagram, poker player Dan Bilzerian, has never been far from controversy since his rise to online fame.

The film shows a stony-faced Bilzerian speaking from behind a desk in his lavish home, complete with gun-shaped candle holder, an action figurine of himself, and a bizarre painting, while lecturing people on 'responsible' gun ownership. And at the end of last year he found himself on the end of a lawsuit after model Vanessa Castano claimed he kicked her in the face in a nightclub. Footage from the scene appears to show Bilzerian dancing on a stage in a club in South Beach, Miami, with the crowd below him, before he lashes out with his foot.

She had tried to claim money for shoots she could not attend following the accident. Bilzerian fought back, claiming the model grabbed at his t-shirt at the last second, nearly dragging him off the roof with her. The charges were eventually dropped. Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler after developing his skills as a student at the University of South Florida.

            "(CNN)For superhero fans, the cup runneth over. Most of us know the members of the Avengers by now: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk and the rest, and the fact that a few more like Quicksilver are joining the cast in the \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" sequel. But there was one character who remained a mystery: the Vision, to be played by Paul Bettany. Thus far, we've only seen his eyes in a trailer. With less than a month to go before the movie hits theaters, Marvel Studios put all the speculation to rest with a poster featuring Bettany as the heroic android, who was a member of the superhero group for many years in the comics. Meanwhile, as many Marvel fans know, Thursday was the eve of the new Netflix series \"Daredevil,\" and after a photoshopped first look at Charlie Cox's iconic red Daredevil suit went out, Marvel put out a video of the real one. Not to be outdone, director Bryan Singer announced a new character for next year's sequel \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" by telling Empire magazine that Ben Hardy would be playing the role of the winged mutant Angel. He even had a photo to share. And Thursday's new super images weren't quite done, because the questions over how Jamie Bell's rocky character The Thing in the rebooted \"Fantastic Four\" movie (out August 7) might look were also finally answered. And he looks ... pretty much like The Thing we already knew (but reportedly, CGI this time). Within 24 hours, we got yet another indication that the superhero trend isn't going anywhere anytime soon (and we didn't even talk about the new photo of Ryan Reynolds' \"Deadpool\").\n",

            "A year after he launched his own app and made headlines, Leo Grand is still homeless . On the night he launched his first app, a homeless man predicted that his life was going to change. 'I can work at Google, I can work at SpaceX,' Leo Grand gleefully stated minutes after his carpooling app Trees for Cars went live. 'This will change my life in a magnificent way.' It's been a year and a half since that moment led to Grand and his mentor, Patrick McConlogue, becoming media sensations. But Trees for Cars is no longer available, and Grand is still homeless, Mashable reported. In August 2013 McConlogue offered Grand, the homeless man he saw every day on his walk to work in New York City, a deal: He would either give him $100, or he would teach him how to code. Grand realized he could go through '$100 in a few days' and instead jumped at the opportunity to learn something new that he could then 'turn into something more,' he told Business Insider in 2013. McConlogue provided Grand with daily lessons, as well as a laptop, wireless hot spot, coding books, a solar charger and office space at the start-up where he worked once it got too cold to type outside. Grand, who once said he wasn't 'the average homeless person' and that he considered himself 'eco-friendly', came up with an app designed to get more cars off the road. 'When I first launched my app it was good,' Grand told Mashable this week. 'I was excited, the press was excited, it was just a great moment.' Grand and McConlogue appeared on TV shows, and he says people loved him everywhere and gave him free coffee at restaurants. Being on NBC, he said, was the highlight of his year. 'We got to stay in a nice hotel at Rockefeller Plaza. A nice, swanky hotel. We got the red carpet rolled out in front of us!' he said. But Grand is still living on the streets, and he said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless. Grand created Trees and Cars after Patrick McConlogue offered him a deal: $100 in cash on the spot or daily coding lessons. Grand picked the latter, and was also provided a laptop, office space and coding books . But Grand is still living on the streets. He said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless . Trees for Cars only made Grand between $10,000 to 15,000 dollars, he said. And McConlogue has since taken a job in San Francisco, although he still meets up with Grand every time he's back in New York. The app is no longer in online stores because Grand does not want to pay for its server space. Grand instead uses the money he made from the app to pay for his storage space. He also keeps some possessions in a shopping cart. He insists that he likes living outdoors, although he said he plans to move into an apartment after he makes his second app. Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have made a different app the first time around. 'I would've probably come up with a better idea for a mobile application that can generate a ton of revenue,' he told Mashable. For now, Grand said he does not code everyday anymore. He said 'life' is the reason for that. 'I've got the books, I've got the laptop, I've got the office space. I just haven't been able to get over there recently.' Grand, who gets by with welding jobs and worked for MetLife until he lost his job in 2011, once said the most hurtful thing someone could say to him was that he was dumb or not intelligent. 'Homelessness is not a feature of someone or a condition,' McConlogue said. 'It is something that people put a lot of people - in a lot of different situations - into one giant box.' Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have 'come up with a better ideal' that would have generated more revenue. He said he only made around $10-15,000 with Trees for Cars .\n",

            "A teenager suffering from cystic fibrosis is battling to be allowed to take part in her high school graduation after school officials told her she couldn't. Victoria McKennon is just one class short of fulfilling the necessary requirements to graduate from Plano Senior High School in Texas. The 17-year-old has had to miss dozens of lessons for frequent hospital visits as she struggles with her life-threatening condition. Scroll down for video . Cystic fibrosis sufferer Victoria McKennon is desperate to take part in the graduation ceremony at Plano Senior High School in Texas but is one class short of the credits she needs . Despite that she is only just short of being able to officially graduate and her family appealed to the school to allow her to take part in ceremony at the Dallas Convention Center in June. The plan was that she would finish the outstanding work necessary to graduate in the summer and earn her diploma that way. But officials initially refused to allow Victoria to join her friends at the prestigious event, which draws a crowd of hundreds to see students proudly don their graduation caps and gowns in the school's maroon colours. Plano High instead told her she could participate in a small summer ceremony, according to the Dallas Morning News, yet she is desperate to take part in the real thing. The school has since set out a way in which Victoria could make up the missing credit and graduate in time for the main summer ceremony. But her mum Grace McKennon said this won't work if her daughter has an unforeseen hospital stay and wants a guarantee from the school she will be able to take to the stage in June no matter what. She told WTHR: 'I don't know how long Victoria is going to live. Of course, we always aim for the moon, the sky, and the stars, but in reality her life span is limited and so every experience is very important for her,' Victoria and her mum Grace McKennon (right) say they do not want her to be awarded credits she didn't get, but allowances made to accommodate her disability . The 17-year-old has to manage a complicated programme of medicines to fight her condition, which has often resulted in hospital stays causing her to miss class . Officials acting on behalf of Plano Senior High School (pictured) have refused Victoria's plea to be allowed to take part in the graduation ceremony in June if she hasn't got the right number of credits . The family say they are not asking the school for Victoria to be awarded credits she didn't get, but to accommodate her disability and allow her to take part in the ceremony with her friends. Victoria says she wants to be seen as a 'normal kid' which is why taking part in graduation is so important to her. The family has filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education over the dispute, under a law which aims to protect disabled people from discrimination. Lesley Range-Stanton, speaking for the Plano Independent School District, said all its schools follow Texas board of education policy, which state that a student must 'meet all state and local graduation requirements, including all applicable state testing,' in order to be allowed to graduate. Victoria was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis 10 years ago. The condition has no cure and greatly affects the lungs and digestive system.

            "Two people on a Delta flight which made an emergency landing in Boston were hospitalized after extreme turbulence which was compared by one passenger to 'King Kong picking up the plane and shaking it'. Delta said 'a small number of customers' on Flight 271 from Paris to Newark Airport in New Jersey, complained of nausea and possible minor injuries and were checked out by emergency medical technicians. A Boston EMS spokeswoman said two people were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital with what are believed to be minor injuries after the unscheduled landing at Logan Airport in Boston. Scroll down for video . A Delta international flight from Paris, France to Newark, New Jersey was diverted to Boston on Wednesday afternoon because of extreme turbulence . Delta 271 flight from Paris to Newark had a turbulent time in the air before it made an emergency landing in Boston, the flight path revealed on Wednesday . During high winds, the plane was unable to land at Newark then attempted to land at JFK in New York but this also proved too difficult. Finally the pilot flew to Logan International in Boston. The airline said Flight 271 from Paris left Boston just after 6pm to resume its journey to Newark, New Jersey where it landed safely. The plane is a Boeing 767-300ER. Delta said 180 passengers and 11 crew members were aboard. One passenger told NBC that it felt like 'King Kong picked up the plane and shook it like there was no tomorrow'.

            "Asbestos has been discovered in the roof at New York City's mayoral residence and work to remove the potentially cancer-causing materials from Gracie Mansion will begin this month. The hazardous material was discovered last month as crews prepared to replace the mayoral mansion's leaky roof. Officials do not believe the work poses any health risk to Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family, who will remain in the home during the renovation. Asbestos has been discovered in the roof at New York City's mayoral residence and work to remove the potentially cancer-causing materials from Gracie Mansion will begin this month . Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray hosting a black history month youth event at Gracie Mansion in February: The family expect to remain in the property during the building work . 'Gracie Mansion is one of Manhattan's oldest structures built more than 200 years ago and as with any older homes, maintenance is necessary,' mayoral spokesman Peter Kadushin said on Wednesday. 'Beginning this month Gracie Mansion will undergo asbestos abatement and some long-needed roof repairs.' The cost of removing the asbestos will be about $250,000 and the contract was awarded this week to Regional Management Inc., officials said. The replacement of the mansion 30-year-old roof, which is being done by Nicholson and Galloway, should cost an additional $3.4 million, officials said. The roof was frequently overmatched during rain storms, forcing city work crews to be dispatched to patch problem areas multiple times this winter, officials said. The two projects will be undertaken concurrently and should be completed by October or November, officials said. de Blasio poses with his son Dante (left), daughter Chiara (right), and wife Chirlane outside of their Park Slope home which the family had considered remaining in before moving to Gracie Mansion last July . A storage shed also is being built on the mansion's property. And officials said that about 10 of the building's windows were undergoing upgrades to become energy-efficient at the cost of another $13,000. De Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, earmarked $3 million to the Parks Department capital budget in 2012 to replace the tired roof. Bloomberg never lived in the mansion during his 12 years in office — he instead opted to remain at his tony Upper East Side townhome — but oversaw extensive renovations to the home, which he used for meetings and ceremonial events. After considering remaining in his Brooklyn home, de Blasio, his wife and their two children moved into Gracie Mansion last July. The home, which is managed by the nonprofit Gracie Mansion Conservancy, was built in 1799, at which time it sat in the countryside more than five miles north of what was then a very small New York City. The mansion was seized by the city in 1896 after its owner failed to pay taxes. It became the official mayoral residence in 1942.

            "The son of a well known nightclub owner who bragged about taking a girl's virginity in an alley is appealing his rape conviction. Luke Lazarus, a 23-year-old former private school boy, was jailed for at least three years on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old virgin in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub in Kings Cross, inner Sydney in May 2013. Lazarus hired Back Schwartz Vaughan - a liquor licensing specialist law firm, who lodged the appeal five days after the conviction, also contested the five year-maximum sentence he received, Fairfax Media reported. Scroll down for video . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub on May 12, 2013 . In the victim's impact statement, which was read out at court on her behalf, the woman said she will never be the same following the brutal attack. 'I thought that once I left the alleyway the pain would go away ... but it didn't,' the statement said. 'Everything that made me who I was stayed in that alleyway.' Lazarus said he thought the sex was consensual and that fact that it wasn't made him: 'absolutely sick to my stomach'. When sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. During Luke Lazarus's rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . This comes as Eastern Sydney's Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a glowing reference for Lazarus 'out of loyalty to the family' after he raped an 18-year-old woman in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub, in Sydney. Now the controversial councillor is developing 'a new risky behaviour education program to try and help young women understand and better deal with being in vulnerable situations'. In an interview with the Wentworth Courier she referenced the behaviour of Lazarus's victim. The Mayor of three years said: 'By the sheer fact of (the assault) happening at a nightclub and alcohol is involved, (means people are) open to the possibility of risky behaviour, so I'm saying let's try and close that loophole.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cr Betts for comment. Cr Betts is reportedly developing the program for school girls alongside Waverley Action for Youth Services (WAYS) and the police. During Lazarus's trial, the jury was told that he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into the alleyway. The court heard that during the assault he pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for convicted rapist Luke Lazarus and is now developing 'a new risky behaviour education program' for young women . When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. In a text message to a friend the afternoon after the attack, in the early hours of May 12, 2013, Lazarus said: 'I honestly have zero recollection of calling you ... Was a sick night – took a chick's virginity.' His friend replied: 'bahahahaha nice popping does cherries ... ' Lazarus replied: '... it's a pretty gross story tell ya later'. Cr Betts said in the character reference she wrote for Lazarus that his conviction was 'inconsistent with the gentle well-mannered and respectful young man that I know'. She also said she had no hesitation supporting Lazarus and his family. In a recent interview with the Wentworth Courier she said she wrote the reference in support of Lazarus's grandparents whom she has been friends with for 30 years. 'They are shocked and devastated and I wrote in support of them,' she said. Sally Betts has been the Mayor of Waverley for three years in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed the public figures in the local community who supported Lazarus. Along with Cr Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice,' she said. On Thursday, Federal Member for Wentworth and Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull, whose electorate takes in Betts' council area, refused to endorse her to continue in her position. Turnbull's office declined to respond when probed by the Guardian over whether he would support her as mayor. A council investigation is currently underway to determine whether she broke the code of conduct. On Facebook a campaign page with over 200 likes has begun calling for her removal from office. 'As a community we must stand against our elected leaders supporting convicted rapists. Sally Betts Mayor of Waverley needs to know that she must go,' the page says. Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' Last week, nightclub promoters apologised after a photo of a young woman sprawled out on a tiled-floor was used to advertise their Easter weekend event - just a week after Lazarus was convicted of raping a teenage girl at the venue. A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3. The photo's caption said: 'We're throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight – get amongst it!' The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter, the Daily Life reports, with one shocked social media user complaining: 'This is how Luke Lazarus (sic) father promotes nightclub SOHO. Posted week after sentencing!'. A Twitter user told Daily Mail Australia : 'Once it did Twitter rounds and people started commenting it was removed by Saturday.' A SOHO management spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'The event on the night was set up by an external promoter as a one-off event. 'He was given access to the official Facebook page but as soon as we noticed he'd put that up it was taken down.' The club agreed that the photo used was '100 per cent inappropriate'. The SOHO nightclub is a popular venue in Sydney's Kings Cross district . Judge Huggett said Lazarus, a South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, came from a privileged upbringing .\n",

            "ISIS has released a chilling new propaganda video warning there is 'no safety for any American on the globe' and claiming the U.S. will burn in another 9/11-style attack. Titled 'We Will Burn America', the video calls on supporters to attack the U.S. on its own soil, while claiming its citizens' sense of safety is a 'mirage'. The 11 minute-long video also forms a showcase of some of the militants' bloodiest atrocities - it features the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley, as well as several mass beheadings and the horrific burning of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh. The video, titled 'We Will Burn America', includes footage of the 9/11 terror attacks and several recent ISIS-inspired atrocities . The video's subtitles claim America 'thinks it's safe' because of it's geographical location . It goes on to state that for this reason, the U.S. believes it can invade 'the Muslim lands' Previous jihadis managed to carry out the 9/11 attacks with 'less resources' than what ISIS currently has, the video claimed. Pictured is Osama bin Laden in a still image taken from the group's propaganda video . Subtitles added to the footage claim that previous 'mujahideen' - a term used to describe someone waging jihad - managed to carry out the 9/11 Twin Tower attacks with little resources. In broken English, it goes on: 'By Allah's willing, the fear will spread among them again soon. 'Here it is America now losing billions still to make sure their country is safe. But today, it's time for payback. 'By the grace of Allah, today the mujahideen are much more stronger and they have more resources (than) before. Thus they are able to burn (the) United States again.' As well as detailing some of the group's acts of savagery, it also shows footage of the planes hitting the World Trade Centre in September 2001. Others incidents to feature in the video include the killings carried out by Amedy Coulibaly, the French-born gunman who massacred four civilians and a police officer in Paris over two days in January. It was after he was killed in a shootout with police that a video surfaced of him pledging allegiance to ISIS, while sitting in front of the group's now notorious black flag. Canadian Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's murder of corporal Nathan Cirillo, at Ottawa's Parliament Hill, is also included. As well as showing footage of ISIS militants in combat, the video shows news footage of the Twin Towers attacks . It also shows news footage which emerged in the wake of French gunman Amedy Coulibaly's deadly rampage, in which he pledged alleigance to ISIS . Another incident which featured in the propaganda video was the October 2014 attack on Ottawa's Parliament Hill . Authorities later said his attack was ISIS-inspired, although Zehaf-Bibeau was said to have mental health issues and a drug addiction. The video is not the first  in which the group threatens the U.S. In January, ISIS militants threatened to behead Barack Obama and turn the U.S. into a Muslim province in another gruesome video that emerged from their self-styled caliphate. The footage showed a black-clad jihadist standing over a Kurdish soldier who, in a sickening climax to the video, has his head cut off. Before the hostage was executed, the ISIS fighter warned the U.S. president: 'Know, oh Obama, that we will reach America. 'Know also that we will cut off your head in the White House and transform America into a Muslim province.' The video's subtitles threatened the U.S. with another 9/11-style attack and claimed its citizens were no longer safe anywhere 'on the globe'. Pictured is a still image from the video . 'America thinks it's safe because of the geographical location. 'Thus you see it invades the Muslim lands, and it thinks that the army of the Jihad won't reach in their lands. 'But the dream of the American to have safety became a mirage. Today there is no safety for any American on the globe. The mujahideen before although they had less resources, attacked New York and bombed the Twin Towers in September Eleven attacks. That blessed incursion was a fatal blow. All praise is due to Allah, the American economy was shaken. In such way Americans lived, and by Allah's willing the fear will spread among them again soon. Here it's America now losing billions still to make sure their country is safe. But today, it's time for payback. By the grace of Allah, today the mujahideen are much more stronger and they have more rescources. Thus they are able to burn United States again.'\n",

            "An Ohio woman discovered that her biological mother worked at the same company as her and lived only six minutes away. The Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month, allowing people their first access to the information. After receiving her records in the mail, La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark, 38, of Youngstown, finally got the answers she's wanted almost her whole life. She looked up her mother's name, Francine Simmons, on Facebook and found out she worked Infocision - the same call-center operation company she works at. La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark (left) of Youngstown, Ohio, found out her birth mother was Francine Simmons (right) after the Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month . 'Ever since I found out that I was adopted I wanted to know who my biological mother was,' Mitchell-Clark told WYTV. And after connecting the dots, she realized her mother was closer than she could imagine. 'There's a Francine that works at my job,' she said after finding the woman on Facebook. 'She works in VR and she works at the front desk.' She reached out to friends on social media who knew Simmons and the next day she got a phone call from her birth mother. 'She called me and I said, \"Is this Ms. Francine?\" She said, yes. I said, \"I think I'm your daughter\",' Mitchell-Clark said about the first time the women spoke. And, as it turns out, the mother and daughter live just six minutes away from one another in Youngstown. Simmons said she was 'still in shock' from finding out about her daughter, who she always wanted to contact but never knew how. Mitchell-Clark (left) reached out through social media to speak with Simmons (right) and they eventually decided to meet after a phone call.

Two of the sisters, Kamala (left) and Maisha (right) Cummings, said that the reunion was 'a relief' and 'amazing' for their family . 'I got pregnant when I was 14. I had her when I was 15. I was put in a home, a girl's home. Had her. Got to hold her. Didn't get to name her, but I named her myself in my heart all these years,' Simmons told WYTV. Mitchell-Clark also found out that she has three younger sisters she didn't know about. Simmons's daughter Kamala Cummings said that meeting Mitchell-Clark has been 'a sense of relief' for  her family, particularly for her mother.

Mitchell-Clark said that her adoptive parents have been very supportive of her search for her biological parents. '(They've) always encouraged me to look for them. They're going to be a part of this, too,' she said.\n",

            "Anti-Hillary Clinton street art emerged in Brooklyn just hours before Clinton's presidential candidacy announcement on Sunday. The signs feature portraits of Clinton with phrases including 'Dont Say Secretive', 'Don't Say Entitled' and 'Don't Say Ambitious'. The street art appears to be a dig at a group of Clinton supporters who said it would be on the look out for evidence of sexism in reporting about the Democratic politician, according to the Weekly Standard. Last month, the New York Times' Amy Chozick brought attention to the efforts made by the group, which goes by the name of 'HRC Super Volunteers'. The descriptive terms that Clinton's fan club said it does not want applied to their candidate include 'polarizing, calculating, disingenuous, insincere, ambitious, inevitable, entitled' and 'over confident.' Scroll down for videos . Pedestrians walk past an anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Secretive' across the street from the purported Clinton campaign headquarters on Sunday in Brooklyn, New York . Another anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Entitled' is affixed to a traffic light across the street from Clinton campaign headquarters where her growing staffers began working on Friday . The posters are said to have appeared in Brooklyn on Saturday night near her campaign's new headquarters in the borough, where staffers began working on Friday. It is not known who created or posted the Brooklyn street art. Following Clinton's announcement on Sunday, a hashtag on Twitter also began trending called #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. In this image taken from video posted to hillaryclinton.com on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announces her campaign for president . A wave of users began using the hashtag giving their reasons for why they would not be voting for the Democratic candidate. One user wrote: '#WhyImNotVotingForHillary #benghazi plus I can't think of anything good she has done.' Another Twitter user wrote: '#WhyImNotVotingForHillary because my vote is based on candidate w integrity, forthrightness & beliefs close to mine, none of which she has.' Following Clinton's announcement on Sunday afternoon, a hasthag on Twitter began trending called #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. Above a user wrote he would not be voting for Clinton because of Benghazi . Another user wrote: 'My vote is based on candidate w integrity, forthrightness & beliefs close to mine, none of which she has' while using the anti-Hillary hashtag . Other users wrote that they are not voting for Hillary because they said 'we need more people like Reagan'. The trending hashtag appears to be started by 19-year-old Markeece Young from North Carolina who rallied users on Saturday night to make it trend on Sunday following Clinton's announcement that she was running for president. On Facebook he wrote: 'Well when I heard Hillary was announcing her campaign on Twitter I came up with the Idea to create ‪#‎WhyImNotVotingForHillary‬ it's simple but very powerful. It was the #1 trending hashtag in America for about 3 hours. On Saturday, user @YoungBLKRepub also known as Markeece Young wrote on Twitter to get the hashtag trending on Sunday when Clinton was scheduled to announce she was running for president . 'The Hillary Clinton campaign had it removed, that's right Hillary Clinton's campaign can delete the #1 hashtag in America for a cost of money. 'I'm proud that people helped me make a statement, I can say I've been causing Hillary problems since day one of her campaign. How many people can say they started the #1 hashtag in the USA and had it deleted by Hillary herself?' Clinton made her presidential campaign announcement on Sunday afternoon  leaning on a message of middle-class rescue and claims that America's economy is 'still stacked in favor of those at the top,' according to the campaign video.\n",

Mata scored both goals as United overturned Liverpool with a 2-1 win at Anfield, while also producing an impressive display in the 3-0 home victory over Tottenham.

            "It took Louis van Gaal less than a minute of his weekly press conference to burst Manchester United's bubble and re-open some of the more troubling issues of his time in charge at Old Trafford. The Dutchman wasted no time in revealing that Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo will miss the much-anticipated clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge through injury. Four players capable of filling two key positions. 'The worst scenario,' Van Gaal called it. Wayne Rooney arrives in London ahead of the Chelsea clash while Ashley Young (right) poses with a fan . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney could be dropped further back into midfield against Chelsea . Rooney had been impressing for the Red Devils in his favoured striking role but United have players out . Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo (right) picked up an injury too . Daley Blind (left) and Phil Jones (right) are also out injured for United ahead of their game with Chelsea . United midfielder Juan Mata posts a picture on his official Instagram of the squad's journey to London . United boss Louis van Gaal (left) and assistant Ryan Giggs (right) carry their luggage on Friday . Van Gaal puts his arm around Rooney during a training session earlier this week ahead of Saturday's game . The uplifting victory in last weekend's Manchester derby has come at a price. All of a sudden, United's chances of extending an impressive run of six straight Premier League wins by becoming the first top-flight team to win away at Chelsea this season look decidedly slimmer. Van Gaal must take on his old apprentice Jose Mourinho without either of his two first-choice holding midfielders, Carrick and Blind, and two senior centre-backs in Jones and Rojo. Blind was hurt in the Manchester derby by a challenge from City skipper Vincent Kompany. It means that captain Wayne Rooney is likely to be asked to sacrifice himself for the team once again by dropping into midfield — an issue that both player and manager must have hoped was behind them. With Robin van Persie not ready to return from injury, that in turn raises the old question about whether Radamel Falcao has the necessary match sharpness to replace Rooney and lead United's attack having not started a game since February. United striker Robin van Persie has not yet been passed fit enough to return to first-team action . There remain doubts over Radamel Falcao's ability to fill the void in United's attack against Chelsea . Luke Shaw is set to take over from Blind at left back despite fitness concerns that have plagued him since his £28million move from Southampton last summer and led to him being hooked at half-time in the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal last month, not to be seen since. And then there's the likely choice of replacement for Rojo between Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, two young defenders who have not featured since January and February respectively. Both figured more prominently in the first half of the season when persistent injury problems and experimental formations slowed Van Gaal's progress. We were back on familiar ground on Friday, the fragility of United's squad all too apparent. Was he concerned by the lack of playing time among the players he may turn to? The United boss answered with one of his Dutch sayings. 'Yes, but that's also a truth like a cow,' he said. 'It means a rhetorical question. You know the answer already. 'There is more balance in the team because I have played the same line-up more. Luke Shaw (left) looks set to return to the United first-team, while Rooney will drop into midfield . 'I didn't have injuries anymore and now, coincidentally, we have four in two positions where we don't have any other players. That's difficult. 'It's the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Jonny Evans is suspended so we don't have many choices. 'Luke Shaw has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don't like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough. 'Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don't have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot.' With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over United, Van Gaal is experienced enough to know that even victory is unlikely to make any difference in the title race. 'It's still possible, I've said that before, but it is not logical,' he added. 'It's more when and if, and I don't believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. 'But, all right, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea's shoulders. You never know, you've seen it in previous Premier League seasons. 'They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw.' United midfielder Mata (right) gets ready to play a pass during a club training session on Friday . Van Gaal, meanwhile, will be satisfied if United hold on to third place and fulfil his primary aim of qualification for the Champions League. But he made it clear that first place is ultimately all that matters and what drives him on at the age of 63 when financial security is no longer an issue. 'We live for these titles,' he said. 'We are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. 'When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed and you have your name on it. That's why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. 'To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is why I'm still a manager because I don't have to work any more — you can count on that.'\n",

            "A mother whose twins were born so early they spent their first two months in intensive care has revealed she almost lost her son Mason a second time after he contracted an extremely rare virus. Lauren Perry, 25, had her waters break just 23 weeks into her pregnancy, and doctors feared the worst. Her twins Mason and Chloe were delivered early via an emergency caesarean at 30 weeks. Lauren Perry's (right) son, Mason (pictured with sister Chloe and dad Mitch Window), contracted a flesh-eating disease . But the parents' fears for the lives of their newborns did not end there. Eight months later when Mason was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh-eating virus. It perforated his bowel and ate tissue from his chest cavity. 'He had his colostomy when he was one-day-old so we had to wait until he was much older and bigger to have it removed,' Ms Perry told Daily Mail Australia. She was forced to deliver her twins via caesarean 10 weeks early after he water broke at 30 weeks . Eight months later when Mason was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh-eating virus . After the surgery, Mason (pictured with his parents) - who was eight months at the time - started going down hill pretty quickly . About a month ago, Mason - who was eight months old - was admitted to Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane to have his colostomy removed, in what his mother described as a 'pretty routine operation'. After the surgery, the young boy went into recovery, but started to go downhill quickly. 'We were holding him and over a few hours he became really hot and had a fever,' Ms Perry revealed. 'His vital signs were dropping and he was having trouble breathing.' 'His stomach just tripled in size and had this red purple rash all over him, and as a mum you just know when something's not right.' Fortunately, Mason recovered from the virus. Here he is seen with his scar after having his colostomy removed . Ms Perry said her son's vital signs started dropping and he was having trouble breathing after the surgery . The infection had eaten all the tissue in Mason's chest and abdomen, leaving him fighting for his life . When the doctor who performed Mason's initial surgery came to check on the infant, he immediately rushed the baby back into theatre for an emergency procedure. 'It was a bug that pretty much just ate all the tissue in his chest and abdomen,' the twins' mother said. 'They said if we'd waited another hour or two he would have definitely died, it attacks so quickly,' Ms Perry added. Mason had contracted necrotising fasciitis, a serious rapidly spreading infection that results in death of tissue. 'It can be fatal if symptoms go undetected - approximately 25 per cent of patients with necrotising fasciitis and more than 30 per cent with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome die,' Fionnagh Dougan, Chief Executive of Children's Health Queensland, told Daily Mail Australia. 'A combination of bacteria caused Mason's case of necrotising fasciitis.' Ms Perry revealed after such a tough few months early on in Chloe and Mason's life, she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again . Thankfully Mason is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal just yet . Ms Perry said her and her partner were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins . Ms Perry praised the work of doctors at Lady Cilento where her son was treated, describing their work as 'amazing'. Ms Doughan echoed this. 'The speed at which Lady Cilento Children's Hospital clinicians identified Mason's symptoms was paramount to his recover,' Ms Doughan said. 'Mason’s treatment included the rapid administration of intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical removal of dying tissue as required. 'We were delighted that Mason responded quickly to the range of antibiotics prescribed to combat the bacteria.' Ms Perry revealed after such a tough few months early on in Chloe and Mason's life, she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again. When her waters broke at 23 weeks, the doctor's prognosis was nothing short of grim. 'They said that normally when your waters break you go into labour within 24 hours and they said that would probably happen,' Ms Perry said. 'They said they couldn't resuscitate a baby that small... so they said it would probably be best to wrap them up and keep them warm and cuddle them for as long as we can.' Luckily after a few hurdles, the twins were able to go home after eight weeks, but when Mason got sick again she thought she may never get to take her little boy home for good. 'I honestly thought I would never get to take him home. I remember just collapsing on the floor with my dad and saying \"That's my baby. What am I going to do if he dies?\"' Ms Perry said. Thankfully Mason is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal. 'I think the professor that operated that said he's never seen something like what happened to Mason and he's lucky to be alive,' Ms Perry said. 'He's not himself, he doesn't want to be put down, and he was starting to crawl and sit up but he can't do that. 'I think he still feels very vulnerable.' But Ms Perry said her and her partner, Mitch Window, were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins. 'We don't take anything for granted,' she said.\n",

            "Veteran CBS News 'Face the Nation' moderator Bob Schieffer announced Tuesday at the Texas journalism school named for him that he'll be retiring this summer. It's not his first retirement announcement but, at age 78, looks like it has a good chance of sticking. Schieffer was speaking to students at an annual symposium that bears his name at Texas Christian University's Schieffer School of Journalism in Fort Worth, his alma mater. 'It's been a great adventure,' Schieffer said at the college. 'You know, I'm one of the luckiest people in the world because as a little boy, as a young reporter, I always wanted to be a journalist, and I got to do that. 'And not many people get to do that, and I couldn't have asked for a better life or something that was more fun and more fulfilling.' Bob Schieffer opens the Schieffer Symposium on the News at TCU on Wednesday, April 8, 2015, in Fort Worth, Texas. CBS says veteran newsman Schieffer is retiring this year . Career: Schieffer began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang . Announcement: Schieffer also posted the news of his retirement to his Twitter account Wednesday night . New career option: Country singer Brad Paisley joked about what Schieffer might do after stepping down from his job with CBS News . On Wednesday night, Schieffer tweeted 'Great talking journalism at @TCU tonight. Also really happy to be in my hometown, where it all started, to announce my retirement.' Journalists and media personalities have been discussing Stelter's announcement on social media. CBS This Morning Anchor Gayle King, who was present when the news broke, uploaded a photograph of Schieffer to Instagram, along with the caption 'Oh what a nite ! @bob schieffer announces he is RETIRInG . . A class act and his announcement stunned the audience at the schieffer symposium.' CNN's Brian Stelter wrote Twitter 'Sandy Livingston, who was at Schieffer announcement in TX: \"It was a stunner to the audience. There were some gasps; I heard some 'Oh nos'\"' 'Bob Schieffer announces retirement from an amazing career: at CBS since '69, hosting Face the Nation since '91. Trusted by both sides,' Fox News' Howard Kurtz tweeted. CNN's Jake Tapper and The Drudge Report's Matt Drudge were also among those who paid tribute to Schieffer on Twitter. Big reveal: CBS This Morning Anchor Gayle King said Schieffer's announcement 'stunned' Stay tuned: King also uploaded this shot of Schieffer to Instagram after the news broke . Tribute: CNN news anchor Jake Tapper called Schieffer a 'legend' Wednesday night . He will be missed: Matt Drudge also said he was 'sad to see' Schieffer retire . A former newspaper reporter at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Schieffer joined CBS News in 1969 and has been the network's chief Washington correspondent since 1992. He began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang. He had an unexpected career highlight starting in 2005, filling in as anchor of the 'CBS Evening News' following Dan Rather's exit for a year and a half until Katie Couric took over the role. His folksy style got good reviews, boosted ratings and healed morale at the news division following the network's discredited report on President George W. Bush's military service. Schieffer survived bladder cancer about a decade ago, a brush with mortality that was one factor in his 2008 announcement that he would retire with the inauguration of a new president in January 2009. That inauguration came and went and Schieffer stayed. He was enjoying the job too much. The death of NBC's Tim Russert, whose 'Meet the Press' led in the ratings for many years, opened Sunday morning to a tighter competition. 'Face the Nation' often led, and CBS responded by expanding the show to an hour. 'I know what you're thinking,' CBS News President David Rhodes said in a memo to his staff Tuesday. 'Bob's thought about retiring before, is he really retiring now? And of course with his long connection to CBS News we'd be happy to learn that he's not leaving now, or that he can be seen by our viewers in the future.' But Rhodes said Schieffer wanted to announce the end of his career where it all began. Rhodes called him 'an inspiration and a mentor to so many colleagues - and, frankly, to me.' CBS would not talk Tuesday about potential successors at 'Face the Nation.' Schieffer hasn't had a single substitute when he took time off; Charlie Rose, Norah O'Donnell, Major Garrett, John Dickerson and Nancy Cordes have all filled in at different times. His chief competitors are Chuck Todd at 'Meet the Press' and George Stephanopoulos at ABC's 'This Week.' Rhodes told Politico '[Schieffer] felt very strongly about doing this at TCU. He's been really deveoted to us, he's had such a long career here - but he's also made a huge investment in TCU. 'His wife is still on the board, his name is on both the journalism and the communications school. He and I have been talking about this for a long time.' CBS News quoted Schieffer as saying Wednesday 'We like any large organization we have had our ups and downs; we're on a high right now. \"Face the Nation,\" I think, is better than it has ever been.' Issues: Schieffer survived bladder cancer about a decade ago, a brush with mortality that was one factor in his 2008 announcement that he would retire with the inauguration of a new president in January 2009 .

            "Historian David Starkey has launched an astonishing attack on the 'victim status' of ethnic minorities and disabled people - and says women are only of average intelligence. The television presenter also gave his views on the current political class, claiming he did not believe any politician was equipped to be prime minister and the 'real talent has left politics'. The outspoken 70-year-old said evidence suggested women tended to be of average intelligence, whereas men were either 'very, very bright or very thick', but denied he is sexist. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Historian David Starkey (pictured) says ethnic minority groups and disabled people should not 'assume the status of victim' In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Telegraph, he hit out at Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of race murder victim Stephen, for following what he claimed was the approach of US civil rights leaders after Martin Luther King's death by 'treating blacks as victims'. He said: 'They espoused victimhood and violence. And I think to a dangerous extent that has happened in this country. With all the praise that's been lavished on Doreen Lawrence, she's constantly treating blacks as victims. 'All forms of liberation, and I speak as gay and I was in all this when it wasn't fashionable, when you didn't get your CBE for being a prominent poofter, when there were actual penalties for doing it - all of them depend upon you taking control. About you refusing to be a victim. David Starkey also hit out at Baroness Doreen Lawrence (pictured), for following what he claimed was the approach of US civil rights leaders after Martin Luther King's death by 'treating blacks as victims' 'And I find it very, very sad the sway there is now this perpetual procession of people - group after group - wanting to assume the status of victim. It's catastrophic.' Starkey, who said he was 'born quite seriously disabled', added people with physical and mental disabilities should not be portrayed as victims. And he claimed fears of Islamophobia were victimising Muslims, making them 'therefore somehow privileged and exempt'. A recent poll showed many Muslims reported higher community tensions, with one in three saying they felt under greater suspicion in the last few years, while 44 per cent of non-Muslims reporting being more wary.\n",

            "Facebook has two days to release all emails to a defense lawyer whose client has fled from criminal charges that he falsely claimed a majority ownership in the social media giant. The documents requested include details relating to a contract with Paul Ceglia during an 18-month stretch beginning in 2003. Ceglia has been on the run for a month after cutting off his electronic ankle bracelet. His father told a court they believe Facebook and the prosecutors were conspiring against him. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick told Facebook Inc. and owner Mark Zuckerberg they have until Monday to relinquish the information that was requested by Ceglia's lawyer, Robert Ross Fogg. The order ignores Zuckerberg's request to wait until Ceglia is caught before handing over the documents. Mark Zuckerberg must release documents and electronic correspondence to a defense lawyer whose client has fled from criminal charges that he falsely claimed a majority ownership in the social media giant . With a May 4 trial approaching, Ceglia cut off his electronic ankle bracelet last month and fled. His wife, two children and dog are also missing from their home in Wellsville, 70 miles southeast of Buffalo. Ceglia's father told Broderick at a hearing last week that he believed his son might have fled because he believed Facebook and Zuckerberg were working together with prosecutors against him, jeopardizing his chance for a fair trial. The judge said he would not allow a trial to proceed unjustly. Federal prosecutors had urged Broderick not to force Facebook and Zuckerberg to turn over the documents, saying doing so would 'reward Ceglia's flouting of the judicial process while unreasonably drawing on the resources of the government and the authority of the court.' The criminal case against Ceglia was brought after a judge threw out his 2010 civil lawsuit claiming that he gave Zuckerberg, a student at Harvard University at the time, $1,000 in startup money in exchange for 50 percent of the future company. Prosecutors said a forensic analysis of his computers and Harvard's email archive determined Ceglia had altered an unrelated software development contract he signed with Zuckerberg in 2003 and falsified emails to make it appear Zuckerberg had promised him a half-share of Facebook. Zuckerberg has said he didn't come up with the idea for Facebook until months after he responded to Ceglia's online help-wanted ad and signed a contract agreeing to create some software for him. A lawyer for Facebook and Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday on the judge's order. Neither did a spokesman for government attorneys nor Fogg. Fogg said in an email Wednesday that he and others 'continue to fight for Paul, even in his absence, with the same vigor and fortitude and in a sense — more determined than ever.'\n",

            "An impoverished father has revealed that he plans to sell his own kidney to fund life-saving treatment for his three morbidly-obese children. Sisters Yogita Rameshbhai Nandwana, five, and Anisha, three, and their 18-month-old brother Harsh, are among the world's heaviest young children. Weighing 5st 5lbs (34kg), 7st 8lbs (48kg) and 2st 5lbs (15kg) respectively, the food they eat in a week is enough to feed two families in a month. Now their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 34, of Gurjarat, India, is planning to sell his kidney to earn the money needed to see top specialists. He said: ‘If my kids continue to grow at this rapid rate they will have major health issues. We’re terrified they will die.’ Scroll down for video . Obese: (From left) Yogita, five, Harsh, 18 months, and Anisha, three, weigh 5st 5lbs (34kg), 2st 5lbs (15kg) and 7st 8lbs (48kg) respectively . Yogita and Anisha eat 18 chapatis, 3lbs of rice, two bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits, 12 bananas and a litre of milk daily. And their extreme hunger means their mother Pragna Ben, 30, spends most of her day making their meals. She said: ‘My day starts with making 30 chapatis and 1kg vegetable curry in the morning. After that I am again in the kitchen preparing more food. ‘Their hunger never stops. They demand food all the time and cry and scream if they’re not fed. I am always in the kitchen cooking for them.’ The couple have one older daughter, Bhavika, six, who weighs an average 2st 7lbs (16kg), and do not know why their other three children are so big. Mr Nandwana said: ‘When Yogita was born she was extremely weak and weighed just 1.5kg (3.3lbs). We were worried for her health. 'So we fed her a lot during the first year of her life to build her strength but by her first birthday she had bloated to 12kg (1st 12lbs). Family: Rameshbhai Nandwana (left), 34, and Pragna Ben (back right), 30, are the parents of Yogita (front left), Anisha (front right), Harsh (front centre) and six-year-old Bhavika (rear centre), their other daughter - who weighs an average 2st 7lbs. They all live together in Gujarat, India . ‘Our third daughter Anisha also gained weight in similar fashion and by her first birthday she was 15kg. ‘But we only realised they were suffering from a disorder when our son Harsh was born as he too gained weight quickly during his first year. 'We started looking for medical help and consulted many doctors but they would just refer us to bigger hospitals that I couldn’t afford.’ Mr Nandwana earns just Rs 3000 (£35) a month - but usually has sufficient money to buy enough food to fulfil the large appetite of his children. He said: ‘I am a daily wage labour and I usually get paid Rs 100 a day but there are times when there is no work at all. ‘I work in fields, dig wells, and do whatever menial job I can find to earn money. 'And I’m constantly worried about finding the money to feed my continually hungry children.’ Despite his paltry income, Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children and said he 'cannot leave them starving' Diet: Yogita and Anisha eat eight chapatis, 4lbs of rice, three bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits and 12 bananas daily . Mother of four: Pragna Ben, 30, tries to lift her five-year-old daughter Yogita . 6am . Five bananas . One litre of milk . Six wheat chapatis . One bowl of vegetable broth . 10am . Five wheat chapatis . One bowl of yoghurt . One bowl of vegetable broth . 12.30pm . Millet chapatti - made of 3.3lbs millet flour . Two bananas . One bowl of vegetables . Four packets of crisps . 3pm . Millet breads . Rice - 3lbs with vegetables . 5pm . 1 litre cold drink (Coca Cola or Pepsi) Six packets of crisps . Five packs of biscuits . Five bananas . 8pm . Six wheat chapatis . One litre of milk . Buttermilk (1.5 litres) Two big bowls of vegetables . He added: ‘If I don’t have the money, I borrow it from my brothers and friends. But I make sure I feed my children when they need.’ The father has spent Rs 50,000 (£540) on seeing doctors and treatment over the last three years – without any improvement in his children’s condition. He said: ‘No one in our family has a giant frame. Only my children are overweight. As parents, it pains us immensely to see them unable to move. ‘They cannot walk; they cannot do anything on their own. Selling my kidney is a desperate measure. But I’m now desperate to get the right help for my children.’ Miss Ben cannot pick up her children so she has to watch them roll around when her husband is at work - or use a trolley to pull them around. She said: ‘They need me to help them bath or when they need the toilet. I’m only 40 kg so it’s impossible for me to pick them up. ‘It’s a struggle when my husband is at work. Hard-working: Anisha hugs her father Rameshbhai, with Harsh. Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children . 'They are usually restricted to the same place for the whole day and because of that, they cannot go to school. 'All they do all day is eat and play and giggle with each other. 'I want my daughters to get an education and play like other kids. I want them to have a life. This is no life.’ Local doctors believe the children are suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, but do not know how to treat it. The rare genetic condition causes various symptoms including constant hunger, reduced muscle tone, restricted growth and learning difficulties. Dr Akshay Mandavia, a paediatrician at Mandavia Children's Hospital in Gujarat, said: ‘There is an abnormal accumulation of fat in these children. ‘They’re not able to breathe properly, and they wheeze. Their condition could be due to endocrinal disease or Prader-Willi syndrome. ‘But we can only ascertain the right treatment after a proper diagnosis at one of our top hospitals.’ Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems. These include: . It is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome number 15, which happens purely by chance, and is usually diagnosed by carrying out genetic tests. Sadly, there is no cure for the condition. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems such as overeating. Parents of children with the condition usually have to restrict their diet and lock up all food . Instead, a team of healthcare professionals will help teach parents to manage any problems the child has, such as overeating. Children usually want to eat frequently, so it is important that most of the food they eat is low in calories, and that access to sweets and fatty foods is restricted. Getting the child to stick to an eating plan voluntarily is practically impossible, so parents usually need to lock any storage areas that contain foods, such as fridge or cupboards. They should also search the child’s room for hidden foods, forbid them to leave the house unsupervised, or play with other children who are eating food, in case they try to steal it. Any family, friends or teachers should be informed of the need to restrict their diet. The child should also be encouraged to exercise as much as possible. If the child has restricted growth, treatment with an artificial version of the human growth hormone (HGH) is usually recommended, as it can increase their final adult height by around 10.5cm (4.1 inches). Most adults with Prader-Willi syndrome are unable to live fully independent lives, such as having a full-time job and living in their own home. Their behavioural issues and problems with food mean these environments and situations are too demanding. Adults with the syndrome who don't live with their parents will probably require residential care. Source: NHS Choices .

            "Economy passengers have long wished they were in first class with lie-flat beds and nice meals, but now it seems there is someone else to envy - the cabin crew. A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video . First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew . The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest . Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning . They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four different continents . Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 . On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner .

            "Kate Winslet was a vision in blue at a London film premiere this week. Her stunning body-con dress (top) had clearly been made to measure by Stella McCartney. But my, what big feet — and big leopard-print stilettos — she has! At 5 ft 7 in, the 39-year-old Oscar-winner is certainly no towering Amazon, but nonetheless she commands an out-of-the-ordinary UK size-nine shoe. Kate is endearingly frank on the subject, telling interviewers that Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio found the size of her feet hilarious: ‘I’d put my foot up and he’d fall about laughing because my feet are exactly the same size as his and he’s 6 ft 1 in. He’d refer to them as my canoes!’ The average shoe size in the UK has risen from a dainty 4½ in 1900 to a roomy six today. But fascinatingly, just like Kate, lots of stars from Elle Macpherson to Gwyneth Paltrow all have surprisingly huge feet, as we reveal here. Titanic feet: At 5ft 7in, the 39-year-old Oscar-winning actress, who loves a strappy stiletto, wears a roomy size-nine shoe . Bigfoot: Kate Winslet has revealed that her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio referred to her feet as 'my canoes' Jerry Hall Size: 8 (US 10) Elle Macpherson Size: 9.5 (US: 12) Katie Holmes Size: 8 (US: 11) The tall Texan, 58, is famous for her long legs and hanging onto Mick Jagger for 21 years. She said: ‘I have big feet, and they keep you firmly on the ground.’ The Aussie supermodel, 51, is also a canny businesswoman. She markets her own brand of foot spa — perfect for feet of all sizes, not just Elle’s sizeable twelves. Even at 5 ft 9in, Katie towered over her pint-sized former husband, Tom Cruise. The 36-year-old actress does have large feet for her height - size 8. Scarlett Johansson Size: 7 (US: 9.5) Sandra Bullock Size: 7.5 (US: 10) Gwyneth Paltrow Size: 8 (US: 11) She’s only 5 ft 3 in, but Scarlett, 30, has feet  larger than the average woman. The star admitted: ‘I like my feet — I think they’re cute.’ America’s sweetheart, 50, hasn’t confirmed her shoe size, but is said to wear 7.5 despite being only 5 ft 6 in. They certainly look big — and match her large hands. Gwynnie, 42, is known for her love of toweringly high heels — Michael Kors, Brian Atwood and Giuseppe Zanotti. Her size eights  seem large on her 5 ft 7 inframe. Angelina Jolie Size: 6.5 (US: 9) Uma Thurman Size: 8 (US: 11) Cate Blanchett Size: 6 (US: 9) Her size nines were derided as ‘weird’ and ‘gigantic’ after Jolie, 39, appeared barefoot in a Louis Vuitton campaign. At 5 ft 7in, her tiny figure emphasises her shoe size. Uma, 44, is a modest 5 ft 11in. She says: ‘I’ve always felt too tall, with big feet.’ Quentin Tarantino disagreed, and insisted on close-ups of her size eight feet in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. At 5 ft 9 in, Cate, 45, struggles to walk in her shoes at times — shedding her Givenchys at a press conference, revealing bunions and red, pinched toes.\n",

            "Deputy PM Nick Clegg said control of the Department for Education would be a key demand of any new power-sharing deal . The Liberal Democrats could seize control of the nation's schools in a coalition deal to erase Michael Gove's 'zany' ideas from the classroom, Nick Clegg signalled today. The Deputy PM said control of the Department for Education would be a key demand of any new power-sharing deal. Mr Clegg said he wanted to avoid a repeat of battling against the 'ideological gimmicks' of Mr Gove, who was the first Tory Education Secretary when the coalition was formed in 2010. Mr Clegg repeatedly clashed with Mr Gove over his education reforms, including Tory plans to scrap GCSEs and a Lib Dem scheme to provide free school meals to under-7s. Mr Gove was demoted from running the ministry in last year's Cabinet reshuffle to become Tory Chief Whip. The Lib Dems have sought to claim the mantle as the 'party of education', pledging to protect spending from 'cradle to college' for 2 to 19-year-olds. In the 2010-15 coalition, the Lib Dems ran three departments: Business, energy and climate change and the Scotland Office. As Deputy PM Mr Clegg oversaw policies across Whitehall, while Danny Alexander also sat in Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, acting as George Osborne's deputy. However, senior Lib Dems believe the party should have demanded one of the key departments running public services, like health or education. Today Mr Clegg signalled that he has his sights set on the Department for Education, which runs schools in England. Asked if it was the kind of cabinet post he wanted, he said: 'I would, particularly having wasted a lot of time dealing with a lot of zany, ideological gimmicks from Michael Gove and his team. 'It would be a good thing if the Liberal Democrats were able to run education policy on our own terms, not least because we are the only party which is prepared to give the schools, colleges and nurseries the means that they need to absorb 400,000 new youngsters in our education system over the next five years.' Campaigning in Cornwall, he announced plans for an independent education standards watchdog to restrict ministers' ability to interfere with the contents of the national curriculum and exams. Mr Clegg said he wanted to 'get politics out of the classroom'. Establishing an Educational Standards Authority (ESA) is part of a plan for England which would also include a new Royal College of Teachers. Other measures include curbing some of the reforms put in place by Mr Gove, with the Lib Dems insisting that all teachers in state-funded schools - including academies and free schools - have qualified status or are working towards it. A slimmed-down core national curriculum would be compulsory in all state schools, bringing free schools and academies in line with those run by councils. Michael Gove was demoted from running the Department for Education in last year's Cabinet reshuffle to become Tory Chief Whip . The Lib Dems have also committed to increase funding for the education budget for two to 19-year-olds by 2020, ensuring that the amount of cash per pupil would be protected in real terms. Mr Clegg said he would 'turn a page on the Gove-esque centralising interference in what teachers teach in the classroom'. He said: 'We are setting out ideas and amplifying ideas today which will take out a lot of the political interference which has dogged the day-to-day life of teachers far too much - from the micromanagement of the history curriculum by Michael Gove through to excessive day-to-day workload.' Mr Clegg also promised to restore morale in the teaching profession. 'I get very distressed when I hear how teachers feel that they have been somewhat put upon in recent years,' he said, promising to 'celebrate not denigrate the great, noble profession'. The Tories tonight hit back at the criticism. A friend of Mr Gove said: 'By zany and ideological, does Clegg mean teaching children to spell properly and do their times tables? 'Or making exams harder? Or training teachers in schools rather than left-wing colleges dominated by the unions? Either he's lost the plot or he's lying again, as he did on tuition fees.' A Conservative Party spokesman added: 'Decisions about what is in the curriculum should lie in the hands of those who can be held to account by parents at the ballot box - not unelected bureaucrats as proposed by the Lib Dems. 'The Lib Dems can't run on their record and run away from it at the same time. They signed up to the new National Curriculum, now they want to re-write it all over again. They voted for extending academy freedoms over the curriculum, now they want to scrap them. 'It's thanks to Conservative reforms that 1,000,000 more pupils are now in good or outstanding schools. Conservative policies have delivered a 71% increase in students taking rigorous academic subjects and ensured 100,000 six year olds are reading more confidently. 'The biggest risk to our education system would be the chaos of Ed Miliband as Prime Minister - and voting Lib Dem will only make that more likely.'\n",

            "Nick Clegg deserves another chance at being in power after suffering the wrath of voters, his wife Miriam said today. The Lib Dem leader's wife said the party's MPs 'deserve' to be re-elected in May after putting the country above their party for five years 'at great personal cost'. She hit the campaign trail on her own today, as Mr Clegg said she 'just wanted to do her bit' for the party. Scroll down for video . Miriam Clegg joined Lib Dem Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone in Hornsey and Wood Green in North London, where they shared a joke over cuddly toy lamb . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg takes a short break from campaigning and takes part in Go Ape Haldon Forest Park near Exeter today . Mr Clegg's wife Mirian said he deserves another chance at being in power after suffering the wrath of voters since becoming Deputy PM in 2010 . Miriam, who uses her maiden name Gonzalez Durantez, today appeared alongside Lib Dem Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone, who is battling to defend a near 7,000 majority in the north London seat of Hornsey and Wood Green. The pair met the cast and crew of a short film examining the girls and gangs in London, being produced by the Exposure project - a youth media enterprise. She is expected to campaign for several women candidates in the run up to the general election on May 7. Speaking to reporters about her role in the campaign, Miriam said: 'I keep my day to day life, I keep working, I'm doing what I did last time which is to help as much as I can. 'I am enjoying supporting women like Lynne - I think Lynne deserves to be re-elected.' She added hat Lib Dems including her husband deserved another chance in power: 'I have seen Nick and these guys for five years putting country above party consistently, every single day. 'Very often at a great personal cost - they deserve to be back.'

Her appearance on the campaign trail comes after a series of high profile visits and media interviews by David Cameron's wife Samantha. Ed Miliband's wife Justine has also given interviews and spoken at campaign events in support of the Labour leader. It suggests that party leaders think their spouses could be key to wooing swing voters in key areas with polls suggesting the election is too close to call.

            "A Neighbourhood Watch official has been handed a restraining order following a bitter row with his neighbours over a garden gate. Married couple John and Karen Copleston claim Paul Phillips, 67, 'constantly harassed' them over a petty dispute after they moved a gate at the back of their £210,000 house in Poole, Dorset. Retired Mr Phillips, the treasurer of the local Neighbourhood Watch scheme, accused the Coplestons of putting the garden gate up on communal land and took the matter to council planners. Scroll down for video . Married couple John and Karen Copleston said neighbour Paul Phillips, 67, had constantly harassed them over a petty dispute after they moved a gate at the back of their £210,000 house in Poole, Dorset . When the couple challenged him they say claim embarked on a campaign of misery that forced the Coplestons to install CCTV cameras to catch him in action. The covert footage caught Mr Phillips fiddling with the gate's lock, waving and smiling at the camera and repeatedly setting off a motion sensor. But on Friday the case against Mr Phillips was dismissed, although a three-year restraining order was imposed on him under the Protection from Harassment Act by magistrates in Bournemouth. The long-running dispute between the neighbours began three years ago and a year ago the row became centred on the gate at the end of a shared passage both houses back on to. Karen and John Copleston (pictured) outside their property - Mr Phillips' home is on the far right . The gate in question: Mr Phillips accused the Coplestons of putting the garden gate up on his land . The Coplestons claim the gate has been at the end of the shared path since they bought the property in 1987. After taking advice from police they moved the gate to halfway down the path where it provides access onto their property - but is also directly next to Mr Phillips garden gate. Mr Phillips, a former Poole council employee, argued the gate should not be there at all as it is in the shared easement. He said the previous gate had been a hazard as it was rusty and did not allow enough room for his wife's invalid buggy. Caught: Paul Phillips, 67, was captured on a covert camera as he repeatedly set off a motion sensor at night . Banned: Phillips was also seen smiling and waving at the camera as he embarked on a campaign of terror . Row: The long-running dispute between the neighbours began three years ago and a year ago the row became centred on the gate at the end of a shared passage both houses back on to . The Coplestons said he continued to complain and would stand outside the gate early in the morning and late at night. They said Mr Phillips even installed his own CCTV cameras on his property which he would use to watch them on a monitor in his bedroom. Mrs Copleston, 49, said: 'All I want to know is why? 'Why did he start this? Why did this happen to us? I don't understand why and that's what's very hard for me.' Mr Copleston, 53, added: 'It started off with something petty and it just got bigger and bigger. 'Luckily, our little camera picked up enough that we could take this to court. 'I don't use computers much myself, so it was always Karen by herself when she saw the footage of him at the gate. 'It's been frightening and very stressful for her and it's had a real effect on her health.' Prosecutor Timothy Sullivan said: 'The proceedings arose out of a long-running acrimonious dispute between neighbours. 'The prosecution says relations broke down as a result of the defendant's anti-social behaviour. 'The victim said she felt like a prisoner in her own home.' The Coplestons pictured with their gate - Mr Phillips' gate and garden are on the left . Pathway: Mr Phillips argued the gate (pictured) should not be there at all as it is in the shared easement . Speaking after the case, Mr Phillips said: 'Myself and my wife are now in the process of selling our home because of this dispute. 'It has been horrific for us. I'm delighted at this result - I couldn't stand another day worrying, 'What's going to happen next? 'I have been a law abiding citizen all my life and have no criminal convictions and have not been in any trouble with the police until this stupid charge was brought up. 'My wife Enid and I have already moved out of our home and into sheltered accommodation to escape the aggression we encountered regularly.'

            "Lucas Leiva would like to remind people it is not just Steven Gerrard playing out his own emotional journey in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley. The Brazilian has been at Anfield for eight years and holds the unwanted record of playing more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years. He missed the 2012 League Cup final and two other Wembley appearances that year with a serious knee injury sustained against Chelsea the previous November. His story might not have the celebrity appeal of Gerrard saying goodbye in an FA Cup final on his 35th birthday, but the desire to win the Cup is just as strong. Lucas has been the longest-serving player at Liverpool behind captain Steven Gerrard (right) Lucas has played more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years . ‘I’ve played at the Maracana a few times but never at Wembley,’ said Lucas, 28. ‘I have been dreaming about it, to be honest. I’ve been at Liverpool so long. Gerrard deserves to win the FA Cup after what he has done for this club. He has won many trophies here but a lot of people here have been working for many years and not won as much as him. We want to win like him.’ When Lucas was signed by Rafa Benitez in 2007, Liverpool had just been in their second Champions League final in three seasons. But he has had to endure turbulent times since then; four managers and a change of ownership that dragged Liverpool into virtual civil war. Not surprisingly, the cup finals and trophies dried up. ‘I didn’t think I was going to stay this long. I felt after the first season I was gone,’ said Lucas with a laugh, having been pilloried by the Kop during his early days. ‘There have been big changes in the club during my time here and at some point you pay a price for that. Sunday will mark Steven Gerrard’s 36th, and possibly last, appearance at Wembley. Thirty-two of his games have been there for England (including one at the old Wembley) and three for Liverpool. Wembley record for England P32 W24 D4 L4 Goals 8 . Wembley record for Liverpool P3 W1 D1 L1 Goals 0 . Three Wembley highlights . England 2-0 Ukraine - 2000 . Makes his England debut at the old Wembley the day after his 20th birthday and impresses enough to earn a place in Kevin Keegan’s Euro 2000 squad. Plays for 81 minutes before replaced by Kieron Dyer. England 2-0 USA - 2008 . Scores his first goal at the new national stadium when he sidefoots Gareth Barry’s pass past American goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Liverpool 2-1 Everton- 2012 . Having lifted the League Cup earlier in the season, Gerrard returned to Wembley for a sweet FA Cup semi-final victory against their Merseyside rivals, with Andy Carroll heading a late winner. ‘There was discussion about ownership, the court and all that. It didn’t help. We saw a lot of senior players leaving. This is a chance for our new team to win their first trophy.’ Lucas has gone from an impressionable youngster learning from Gerrard, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso to one of the senior voices in the dressing room. He has seen youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe criticised for being photographed with a shisha pipe and said: ‘It is hard to give advice because there are so many people always around players. I just think young players shouldn’t get carried away. I had real role models in the dressing room like Pepe and Stevie. You saw they had success because of the way they do things, not just their talent. ‘Ten years ago, players would have more space. Today we go to a restaurant and everyone is filming, recording or taking pictures. You need to have extra care. If you are having a glass of wine, then people say you are drunk.’ Lucas tries to win a tackle during Liverpool's 2-0 victory at home to Newcastle on Monday night . Lucas celebrates Joe Allen's (right) second goal for Liverpool against Newcastle . Lucas is desperate to win the FA Cup and end his 270-game barren spell at Anfield. The last player to have played more times for Liverpool without winning a major trophy was Alan O’Court who played for the club 345 times between 1952 and 1964, collecting just a Second Division championship medal. Liverpool felt so sorry for Lucas, who was injured for the 2012 League Cup final win, they asked the Football League to send him a medal in the post. Liverpool’s improvements under Rodgers have not so far translated into silverware. They finished second to Manchester City in a thrilling Premier League title race last season and were beaten by eventual winners Chelsea in this year’s Capital One Cup semi-finals. Brendan Rodgers knows, with a far stronger squad than he inherited in 2012, they now have to take the cup competitions seriously. ‘For me, the objective in the first couple of years was getting into the Champions League,’ he said. ‘If you look at how we did in the cups we weren’t so good. I felt we didn’t have the squad to challenge. This year we’d arrived into the Champions League and could focus on winning a trophy. We have got to one semi-final already in the Capital One Cup and now we’ve got another chance. Our vision is to win trophies.’ Gerrard has returned to the squad after a three-match ban from being sent off against Manchester United . Gerrard (right) made his Wembley debut for England in 2000 in a friendly against Ukraine . The return of Gerrard into the squad after a three-match ban for stamping on Manchester United’s Ander Herrera is vital to calm any nerves. In contrast to Lucas and others in the Liverpool team, he has played at Wembley 35 times in his career — and been on the winning side in 25 of them. Rodgers smiles that he will be ‘heartless’ in deciding whether to name his captain in the starting XI but is adamant Gerrard will make a big contribution. ‘I’ve had a meal with him, talking over things,’ said the manager. ‘I am disappointed I didn’t have the chance to work with him for longer. At 24, I would have built a team around him like I did with Luis Suarez. ‘Wembley is like his second home. He knows what it takes to win there. He’s calm anyway before the games and that is important for us as a team. Everyone respects that I want to do what is best for the team. Status and star quality have never bothered me, really.’\n",

'My m8 Robbie Keane having a sing-a-long in the car! 'Go on Robbie!' said the post. Robbie Keane sings Karma Chameleon iin a video posted on Boy George & the Culture Club's Facebook page . The video was apparently filmed during LA Galaxy's day off on Tuesday with Keane choosing a song that was released when he was just three years old. Boy George, real name George O'Dowd, is a noted fan of the Galaxy and regard Keane as a friend from the Irishman's days in the Premier League where he lead the line most notably for Tottenham, Liverpool and Leeds. Karma Chameleon was the second Culture Club song to go to No 1 in the UK, after Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?, and also peaked at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1983 . Keane, who is sidelined by a groin injury, was in the crowd alongside former Galaxy pin-up David Beckham on Sunday as his side beat the Seattle Sounders 1-0 at their StubHub Center.

Sometimes stubborn house owners get in the way, as these incredible images show. These are the ‘nail’ houses in China left standing after their owners refused to give in to property developers vying for their demolition. Homes such as these in China are known as 'dingzihu' or 'nail houses' because they stick out and are difficult to remove, like a stubborn nail. Scroll down for video . Last house standing: A car stops beside a house in the middle of a newly built road in Wenling, Zhejiang provinc .

According to local media, the owner of the house didn't reach an agreement with the local authority about compensation for the demolition.

            "The family of a Massachusetts woman who died from melanoma likely caused by her love of tanning are campaigning for a change to laws governing sunbeds. Glenna Kohl of Barnstable spent years in the sun as a Cape Cod lifeguard and countless hours laying in indoor tanning beds while at college. She was diagnosed with melanoma just after graduating from a Rhode Island college in 2005. Three years later, at just 26 years old, Glenna would be dead after a painful cancer battle. Now, her parents want the world to know the very real dangers posed by tanning even to the very young. Sad: Glenna Kohl of Barnstable spent years in the sun as a Cape Cod lifeguard and countless hours laying in indoor tanning beds while at college. She was diagnosed with melanoma just after graduating from a Rhode Island college in 2005 . Started in high school: Glenna was an avid tanner starting in high school and would sit in the sun some 40 hours per week every summer while working as a life guard in Cape Cod. In college, she tanned frequently in sun beds . Glenna was diagnosed with stage III melanoma after she found a golf ball sized lump in her groin just before graduating from college in 2005 . 'No one in our family knew what melanoma was,' Glenna's mother, Colleen Kohl, recalled to Cosmopolitan (via ELLE) 'We did a lot of crying.' The dreaded diagnosis came after Glenna, at just 22, discovered a golf ball-sized lump in her groin while working out at the gym one day. She would eventually see a doctor and get a biopsy. Physicians would trace the cancer back to a mole Glenna had removed years earlier, but which doctors had failed to identify as melanoma. By then, she already had stage III melanoma. But Glenna was prepared to fight. 'Whatever I have to do to fight cancer, I'll do,' her father Bob recalls his daughter saying. Because the cancer had spread to her lymphatic system, doctors removed 13 lymph nodes from her groin. Less than a year later, Glenna found a small lump in her abdomen and was told her cancer had progress to stage IV. Glenna was given more powerful drugs, but the cancer continued to spread. She tried experimental treatments with terrible side effects, but they were no use. Glenna died in November 2008, three years after her diagnosis--and her final tanning session. 'As health-conscious as Glenna was, she didn't connect tanning with skin cancer,' said Glenna's mother, who's now working to make sure others will make that connection before it's too late. 'Glenna's not here to inform people of the dangers,' Colleen told Cosmo. 'so we're going to continue her work for her.' Since their daughter's death, Colleen and Bob have launched the Glenna Kohl Fund for Hope in order to 'increase awareness of the Cape Cod community to the importance of early detection and prevention of melanoma and to support those fighting this deadly disease.' h/t YouTube/Maryellen Maguire-Eisen . Because the cancer had spread to her lymphatic system, doctors removed 13 lymph nodes from her groin. Less than a year later, Glenna found a small lump in her abdomen and was told her cancer had progress to stage IV . Glenna died in November 2008, three years after her diagnosis--and her final tanning session. Thanks in part to the group's efforts, the state of Massachusetts in 2014 passed a bill banning indoor tanning for those under 16 and requiring express consent from parents for those aged 16 or 17. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer with 9,000 people dying each year from the mostly preventable disease. The Melanoma Research Foundation says exposure to tanning beds before age 30 increases a person’s risk of developing melanoma by 75 percent. Doctors recommend doing regular skin checks for new moles and seeing a doctor if any change in size, shape or color. Doctors also recommend applying at least 1 ounce of sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more to exposed skin and reapplying every two hours, more if swimming or sweating. Children in particular should be protected because bad sunburns in childhood are thought to greatly increase risk later in life.

            "Video footage has emerged of a drunken stag party group who caused mayhem on a flight from Scotland to Spain. Fellow passengers sat stunned as the yobs - some of whom were shirtless - sung and swore their way from Glasgow to Alicante on a Jet2 flight last Friday morning. Witnesses said the group drank heavily, abused fellow passengers and airline staff and refused to sit down when the aircraft was landing. Scroll down for video . Footage has emerged of a drunken group of yobs on board a Jet2 flight from Glasgow to Alicante last week . Spanish police were called by cabin crew to escort one of the party, a man in his thirties, off the aircraft when it arrived in Spain. All passengers on the Jet2 flight had to wait in their seats as the plane waited on the runway while officers dealt with the situation. Mobile phone footage of the incident shows a female passenger arguing and grappling with a group of men in the aisle of the plane. One passenger said: 'It was the most horrendous flight I have ever been on. 'There was a large stag party who boarded the plane at Glasgow and they obviously had already had a lot to drink. 'They were shouting, singing and swearing throughout the flight. A few of them took their tops off and refused to sit in their seats when told to.' The video shows the group - some of whom are shirtless -  jostling a woman who tries to calm them down . The incident took place on a Jet2 flight to Alicante, where the men were heading for a stag party . The passenger added: 'One of them in particular was swearing constantly and getting into arguments with other passengers. The airline staff were struggling to cope with his rowdiness. 'There were families on the flight and the behaviour was totally out of order. When we landed we were all held on the flight to wait for police to come on board and remove one of the guys. 'One woman got really frustrated at the delay and got involved in a bit of a pushing match with the group.' The group, who were travelling to the Spanish holiday resort of Benidorm, left Glasgow airport for the three-hour flight to Alicante on Friday morning. It is understood the man who was held by police was later released and he was banned from travelling home on his booked Jet2 flight. One man was escorted from the plane after it landed in Alicante (pictured). He was banned from flying back . A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: 'We can confirm that following disruptive behaviour on flight LS177 from Glasgow to Alicante a passenger was denied boarding on his return flight. 'The safety and security of our customers is paramount and this particular passenger's conduct on the outbound flight was disappointing and not acceptable. 'This was an isolated incident and was certainly not representative of our passengers who are often families and couples just on their way to enjoy their holiday.' Earlier this month, Ryanair announced they were banning alcohol on a notorious flight from Scotland to party island Ibiza. The airline told passengers travelling from Glasgow Prestwick to the Spanish isle that they will no longer be able to take alcohol on board.\n",

            "A headteacher who allegedly used his school email to set up a threesome with a prostitute who he wanted to spank while she was dressed as a schoolgirl, has resigned from his post. David Nicholson, 48, sent the woman explicit messages saying he was 'keen' on her dressing up like a pupil and was 'looking forward to putting you over my knee', it is claimed. The married father-of-four has not returned to The Costello School in Basingstoke, Hampshire, since the correspondence came to light last month, and has now left the school. MArried father-of-four David Nicholson is accused of sending messages to a prostitute about spanking her when she is dressed up in school uniform using his official school email . Mr Nicholson, from Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, is still under investigation by Ofstead after claims he used his official school email address to contact an £150-an-hour escort through an adult website and arrange a meeting with her and another woman. The Sun newspaper published the messages between Mr Nicholson and the escort, which showed her telling him she liked dressing up as a schoolgirl and being spanked. The Cambridge graduate then allegedly responded: 'I love this and would be keen,' adding that he he was 'looking forward to putting u over my knee'(sic). Mr Nicholson, is said to have organised a liaison in a hotel room on a night when he was due to be working away from home, which was then cancelled, according to the paper. In a statement today, Mr Nicholson said: 'As I am sure you will understand, the recent press coverage has been highly distressing. Resigned: Mr Nicholson started as headteacher at The Costello School in Basingstoke in September last year . 'Although I have been very grateful for the many messages of support and understanding, I have to put both the interests of my family and the school community first. 'It is therefore, with huge regret and disappointment that I have taken the very difficult decision to resign as headteacher of The Costello School. Accused: Mr Nicholson allegedly used his school email to send messages to prostitutes . 'I have been very privileged to have served as headteacher of the school and proud of the opportunities I have set up. I wish all at the school every good fortune in the future.' Having previously worked as a head teacher at a school in Chippenham, Wiltshire, Mr Nicholson, moved to the Costello School, which counts Liz Hurley among its alumni, last September, . Mr Nicholson, who lives with his wife of 15 years Karina, 43, a local councillor, and describe himself as a ''husband and father' on his Twitter account is also training to be an Ofsted inspector. Carol Bode, the school's chair of governors, said that there are no concerns relating to the safeguarding of pupils at the school and confirmed that the board has accepted Mr Nicholson's resignation. 'In the time David was with us, he worked tirelessly for the school and always with our students best interests at heart providing the school with clear leadership and direction and maintaining a tireless focus on their educational progress. 'We wish him well for the future. The Governing Body's commitment remains to our students, staff and local communities.' She added: 'Please be assured that for the school it is 'business as usual' and that our total focus is on our students, their learning and progress. 'The School is in the capable hands of Mr Leigh Adams, Acting Head Teacher and his senior leadership team, and all staff and students have responded magnificently over recent weeks.'\n",

Gerardo Martino's Argentina, with captain Messi looking on again while he nurses a right foot injury, had beaten El Salvador 2-0 in Washington on Saturday.

            "A Perth man has pleaded guilty after downing a bottle of vodka at Auckland Airport and groping the breast of a female passenger on his Qantas flight home. The New Zealand Herald reports that Milinda Gunasekera, 32, was flying home from a holiday in Chile on October 29 and was changing flights at Auckland Airport for the final leg of his trip. However, after downing a bottle of vodka in the airport toilets his plans to get home soon went awry. Milinda Gunasekera was flying from Auckland Airport to Perth after a holiday in Chile . The Qantas flight was taxiing to the runway when the alleged incident with a female passenger took place. the West Australian resident, was originally accused of indecent assault and threatening to kill - offences carrying a maximum of seven years in jail. But after the file was reviewed by Crown law, the charges were amended. Mr Gunasekera will return to New Zealand in June to be sentenced.

            "Malky Mackay's bid to rescue his managerial career was left in tatters on Monday night after he was sensationally sacked by Wigan Athletic. The 43-year-old was told of the decision during a brief meeting with new chairman David Sharpe after the Latics lost 2-0 at home against Derby County. Mackay was handed the job by former owner Dave Whelan back in November to a backdrop of an FA investigation into a shocking series of text messages, exposed by Sportsmail. Wigan manager Malky Mackay has been sacked after just five months in charge, with Wigan facing relegation . Mackay gesticulates on the touchline during the defeat to Derby County, which would prove to be his last . Cardiff City manager at the time, Mackay is accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic messages in an exchange with former head of recruitment Iain Moody. The Scot remains under investigation by the FA and Monday’s developments will not alter the speed in which his case is dealt with. Sharpe, 23, looked forlorn after defeat against Derby and made a snap decision to axe the boss just a month into the new role. It was a result to leave the club eight points off Championship safety with only five games left and the chairman was potentially swayed by terrace chants to sack the manager as goals from Chris Martin and Darren Bent plunged Wigan closer to relegation. They must win their next two games against Fulham and Millwall to stand any chance of survival. Although Wigan did not announce a caretaker manager, such was the haste of Sharpe’s decision, Gary Caldwell is expected to be handed the job on a temporary basis. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs is highly thought of. John Doolan, who formed part of Uwe Rosler’s backroom staff at Wigan, is first team coach to Stubbs. Ex-player Danny Wilson presents another option. Mackay won just five of his 25 fixtures in charge and picked up only three home points - damning statistics referenced in the club’s official statement last night. Sharpe said: ‘This is a very difficult decision to make but I feel that, for the long-term future of the club, there needs to be a change now.’ Sportsmail understands Mackay was close to suffering the sack back in February but victory away at Reading granted him a stay of execution. Wigan were content with keeping their boss until at least the end of the season and had faith in the divisive figure. Sources at the DW Stadium also indicated that Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. He remained defiant that they could stay in the division immediately after losing against Derby: ‘It’s still mathematically possible. I’ve got a team there which is putting performances in every week. It’s fine lines between winning and losing in this league.’ Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in their win over Wigan on Monday . Substitute Darren Bent puts the result beyond doubt, sealing Mackay's fate as Wigan lost again . May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City. June 2011: After Dave Jones is sacked following a Championship play-off semi-final defeat, Malky Mackay is appointed manager. February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time. May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post. Tan controversially decides that the club's shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon — causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters. September 2012: Tan replaces the club's chief executive, Alan Whiteley (left), with associate Simon Lim. April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship. August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment. October 2013: Mackay's head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds. December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given 'a single penny' for transfers. December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked. December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager 'for the foreseeable future'. December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan. December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager. November 19 2014: Mackay returns to football as Wigan manager . November 27: Wigan chairman Dave Whelan is charged with ‘aggravated breach’ of FA rules for his comments after appointing Mackay . March 3 2015: Dave Whelan steps down as Wigan chairman, replaced by David Sharpe . April 6: Mackay is sacked by Wigan after just five months in charge .\n",

            "Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff sees no reason to go cap in hand to the powers that be within the German giant and demand extra revenue to fight off the new threat of Ferrari. From out of the blue, it was the scarlet red of Ferrari that was back on the top step of the podium for the first time in almost two years last time out in Malaysia, pushing reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg down to second and third. From the threat of another Silver Arrows-dominated campaign in the wake of last year's stunning success and crushing start to the season in Australia, Formula One was provided with a much-needed tonic with Ferrari's return to winning ways courtesy of Sebastian Vettel. Sebastian Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . Vettel (right) won the second race of the season following Mercedes' dominance last year . That led to speculation Wolff was prepared to ask for more funds from the Mercedes board to ensure his team stayed ahead of the pack. But a dismissive Wolff said: 'We have everything we need. 'We feel confident in the resources we have, the staff we have, and that we are well-placed. 'We just need to stay calm, continue to develop and put the right things on the car. 'Maybe we put some things earlier on the car than planned, but there is no reason to panic. 'We are back into a regular racing season where you have more than just one contender, and more than one-twos every single weekend. It's back to normal business.' Mercedes chief Toto Wolff claims the champions will just keep calm and carry on . Mercedes will look into reasons why the team was beaten into second and third in Malaysia . Wolff insists his team has left no stone unturned since the race in Malaysia in a bid to uncover what went wrong, even though most teams would jump through hoops for a two-three finish. 'Although we had two cars on the podium, we have been looking very carefully at every area where we could have performed better,' said Wolff. 'Our opposition has raised its game and we must now raise ours even further. 'As we have said since Melbourne, we expect a season-long battle for both world championships and we must maximise every opportunity. Rosberg (left) and Hamilton visited Mercedes' Brackley base to go through their cars on Thursday . 'China is the next chance to do that - a circuit which has been a good hunting ground for the team. 'Lewis has a great record here, and for Nico it's where he made his first step into the winners' circle. 'We have the weapons at our disposal and we need to make the most of them this weekend.' Hamilton is a three-time winner at the Shanghai International Circuit - including last year - whilst he has been on the podium on three other occasions. Rosberg, meanwhile, was second to Hamilton last year after triumphing in 2012. Like Wolff, Hamilton knows more can and will be done, as he said: 'Malaysia was a tough weekend. Hamilton heads to Shanghai having won the Chinese Grand Prix last year on his way to the title . 'It always is with the heat, but with car problems on Friday, rain during qualifying on Saturday and a race which didn't go to plan on Sunday, that one was particularly challenging. 'Ultimately we made the best choices we could, but there is always room for improvement and we've been working hard to analyse everything for the next race in China. 'The circuit is one I really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well. 'I won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice, so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front.' The British driver is congratulated by film star Arnold Schwarzenegger after winning the Australian Grand Prix . From his perspective, Rosberg is far from happy with his two races to date which have seen him finish second and third. 'It's not been a perfect start to my sixth year with the team and I'm determined to turn that around this weekend,' insisted Rosberg. 'Of course, my team-mate will have other ideas, so will my compatriot in the red car (Vettel) I'm sure. 'But this is a track that has always suited me well, so I'm aiming to put in a strong weekend.'\n",

            "The head of an elite Victorian private school has resigned after a photograph of him looking at pornography on his work commuter circulated on social media. Andrew Barr, principal of The Geelong College, south-west of Melbourne, was allegedly photographed through a window as he watched pornography in his school office. The school council launched an investigation, which included a search of   Mr Barr's computer, after the photograph appeared on the social media site Snapchat. Andrew Barr, who was Principal of Melbourne's The Geelong College, has resigned after a photo taken of him watching pornography in his office went viral on the internet after being published on Snapchat . Chairman of the Geelong College council, Dr Hugh Seward, told the Geelong Advertiser yesterday the matter was a serious breach of the school's standards, even if the investigation found Mr Barr not to have broken any law. 'The matter was taken very seriously,' Dr Seward said. 'Just before Easter, The Geelong College council became aware of a matter of concern that might constitute a breach of our standards.' 'The council immediately looked into the matter and when our concerns were confirmed, Andrew Barr tendered his resignation.' In a statement, Dr Seward thanked Mr Barr for his contribution to the school since he joined the college in 2013. ‘In the two years since his appointment, Mr Barr has made an enduring contribution to the College’s educational vision and future planning. The Council is grateful for Mr Barr’s commitment and achievement,' he said. Chairman of the Geelong College council, Dr Hugh Seward, said the matter was a serious breach of the school's standards . Mr Barr is a former chairman of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and previously served 10 years as principal of Scotch Oakburn College in Melbourne. Dr Seward told the Geelong Advertiser the investigation confirmed Mr Barr had not broken any law and 'at no point' did his actions affect the care provided to students. The Geelong College Council has since announced it has begun searching for a new Principal.\n",

            "A woman made a horrifying discovery when she opened a taped cardboard box labeled 'stuff animals' only to find three puppies covered in urine and suffering from heat exhaustion. The eight-week-old Labradors were found near a Tennessee Goodwill donation site on April 18 without any food or water inside of the box where temperatures were reportedly over 100 degrees. The puppies have worms and are malnourished, and it is likely they have lived their entire lives in a cage, according to McKamey Animal Center where the dogs are being treated. Scroll down for video . Three eight-week old puppies (above) were found inside of a sealed cardboard box on April 18 . The Labradors were found by a woman who said the dogs were covered in urine and suffering from heat exhaustion when they were discovered in the box labeled 'stuff animals' The animals have been named Greta Garbo, Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe, and have been flourishing since they began treatment, according to ABC. The good Samaritan, who has not been identified, was driving by and saw the box moving when she approached it tearing a hole into the top finding the dogs. 'She said when she opened the box, she could feel the heat come out. They had been there for a while,' Chelsea Fogal, veterinarian at McKamey Animal Center told WTVC. 'It is frustrating when you have someone do something so neglectful and inhumane,' she added. 'But I think these guys really lucked out that someone, a Good Samaritan, came along and found them. 'I think the outcome could have been a lot worse.' The woman then took the puppies to the animal center for treatment. On Facebook, McKamey wrote that the box was securely taped to prevent their escape. McKamey Animal Center in Tennessee, where the dogs have been receiving treatment, said they have worms and are malnourished, and it is likely they have lived their entire lives in a cage . On Facebook, the animal center said the puppies appear to have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition . 'There was no air ventilation for the puppies and they were covered in urine and suffered from heat exhaustion--the temperature in the box was estimated to be well over 100 degrees,' the center wrote. 'The box had been left at a Goodwill drop off site near HWY 58. The dogs were over heated and covered in urine from a long period of time being inside the box. 'All three dogs are being treated at McKamey Animal Center. 'It would appear they have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition.' Once the puppies complete their treatment at the center, they will be put up for adoption . An animal service officer investigating the case said they have dozens of leads regarding the incident . The puppies will be put up for adoption once they finish being treated at the center. The McKamey is offering a $200 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the incident. Chattanooga Goodwill Industries is grateful for the quick thinking and reaction of the woman who noticed and rescued the three puppies that were left on the sidewalk near the vicinity of one of its donation center trailers, a representative of the company said in a statement to ABC. A representative from Chattanooga Goodwill Industries (file photo above) said they are grateful for the quick thinking and reaction of the good Samaritan . The representative also said the attendant on duty was unaware of the situation and had not been approached or contacted by the woman discovered the box.

'It happened in the middle of the day, so someone had to see something,' Leslie Stokes told ABC. 'We are trying to get surveillance video from someone at Goodwill to see if there were any cars that pulled in.'\n",

            "Facebook has come under fire after removing a video that shows Aboriginal women in a traditional ceremony because they were topless. The social media site deemed the clip, which shows two elderly women painted in ochre in a trailer for upcoming ABC TV show 8MMM Aboriginal Radio, as containing 'potentially offensive nudity'. The video had already had 30,000 hits when it was removed after three days on Sunday.

The show's co-creator Rachel Clements told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'I've moved from anger to disappointment to just bewilderment, really,' Clements said. 'I just think it's silly and disrespectful to the women who were dancing for us. 'Out of all the reasons we could have been pulled, nudity is not high on the list. It's ridiculous.'

Monika Bickert, the company’s Head of Global Policy Management, said: ‘It’s a challenge to maintain one set of standards that meets the needs of a diverse global community.’ ‘For one thing, people from different backgrounds may have different ideas about what’s appropriate to share — a video posted as a joke by one person might be upsetting to someone else, but it may not violate our standards,’ she added.

We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. 'We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures.

            "A Chinese-born American geologist was deported and returned to his Texas home following his release from prison in China after serving nearly eight years on charges of 'illegally procuring state secrets'. Xue Feng returned to his family in Houston on Friday following his release from Beijing's No. 2 Prison. He served all but ten months of his eight year sentence after getting it reduced for good behavior. Xue Feng returned to his family in Houston, Texas, on Friday following his release from Beijing's No. 2 Prison . The 50-year-old doctor served all but ten months of his eight year sentence at the Chinese prison (pictured) Xue Min (right) waits with daughter Guo Jie (left) for the trial of her brother outside a Chinese court in 2010 . At the time of his release, Xue was the only American citizen serving a sentence in a Chinese prison for the crime of endangering state security, according to the  Dui Hua foundation. The foundation has long advocated on Xue's behalf. Executive director John Kamm said: 'Dui Hua is delighted that Dr Xue has finally been reunited with his family in America after a terrible ordeal,' 'The foundation wishes him every success as he rebuilds his life.' The 50-year-old Xue was detained in November of 2007 and sentenced in 2010 on charges of illegally gathering information on China's oil industry. His case raised questions about whether normal business activities elsewhere might conflict with China's vague state security laws. Supporters also said Xue was physically abused in detention and denied proper legal rights. American diplomats had lobbied hard for Xue's release, saying his alleged crimes didn't warrant the harshness of his sentence. Tong Wei, the lawyer for the jailed American geologist, seen leaving Beijing High People's Court in 2011 . President Obama personally lobbied for Xue's release during a visit to Beijing in November of 2009, the New York Times reported. After a court upheld Xue's conviction in February of 2011, American ambassador Jon Huntsman said: 'This has been a long, difficult and painful ordeal for Xue Feng, but not only for Xue but also for his wife, Nan, and his two kids. 'We ask the Chinese government to consider an immediate humanitarian parole of Xue Feng, thereby allowing him to get back to his family and his way of life.' Xue was born in China and earned a doctorate at the University of Chicago, where he was praised by his advisers for his thoroughness and hard work. After becoming a United States citizen, he returned to his native country to work for US consultancy IHS Energy, now known as IHS Inc. In pronouncing him guilty, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court said his actions 'endangered our country's national security'. The verdict said Xue received documents on geological conditions of onshore oil wells and a database that gave the coordinates of more than 30,000 oil and gas wells belonging to China National Petroleum Corp. and listed subsidiary PetroChina Ltd.\n",

            "A student expelled from George Mason University for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name, arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing, not sexual assault. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday in Alexandria. The ex-student has sued under a pseudonym to protect his privacy. The university is demanding he identify himself publicly, despite arguments that doing so would expose not only him but the woman who says she was assaulted. The student says he had been in a longstanding relationship with the woman, and that they frequently engaged in sadomasochistic role playing that involved using a safe word if one or the other wanted to stop. Lawsuit: A student expelled from GMU for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name, arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing, not sexual assault (file) The lawsuit comes as colleges across the country, and particularly in Virginia, are under increased scrutiny for how they respond to allegations of sexual assault. The University of Virginia implemented changes in its sexual misconduct policy in the aftermath of a now-discredited Rolling Stone article alleging that school officials were indifferent to allegations that a student had been raped at a fraternity party. The sexual misconduct allegations at George Mason stem from an October 2013 encounter with the couple in the male student's dorm room on the Fairfax campus. At one point, according to the lawsuit, she pushed him away but didn't invoke her safe word. Later that night, the two engaged in a second sex act, in which the male student asked her if she was interested, and she replied, 'I don't know.' According to the lawsuit, the couple remained romantically involved for several months, but they broke up after she found that he had been cheating on her. It was only then that she filed a complaint against him, according to the suit. In September, a university panel conducted a 10-hour hearing to determine whether the student had violated the university's code of conduct. A three-person panel cleared him of any wrongdoing, according to the suit. But the woman appealed, and a university administrator, Assistant Dean of Students Brent Ericson, overruled the panel and expelled the student. Process: The lawsuit claims the woman only filed a complaint after the couple broke up and she had found out the man was cheating on her (file) The lawsuit says that the appeal was handled improperly. It seeks an order that would strike the violation from his student record, and $3 million in damages. The lawsuit claims that the expulsion was a result of gender bias, and also claims that it violated his right to engage in constitutionally protected sexual activity. 'The only explanation for such a rash, unreasoned, and unsupported decision is Mr. Ericson's desire to help a complaining female when the system had found a respondent male not responsible. If Jane Roe (the pseudonym for the unidentified female student) were not a female complaining of sexual assault, her testimony would not have been credited over John Doe's given the evidence corroborating John Doe's explanation of their BDSM relationship and the material concessions Jane Roe made at the hearing,' the student's lawyers wrote in their complaint. A GMU spokeswoman declined comment on the lawsuit. The university, in court papers, wants to overturn a judge's decision allowing the student to sue anonymously. The university's lawyer writes that the male student should have no fear of embarrassment if the allegations are true, because the public is increasingly accepting of unusual sexual relationships. And he argues the risk of the woman's identity being exposed is minimal compared to the public's right to an open judicial proceeding. 'Even if Ms. Roe is identified simply by the fact that Mr. Doe is identified, there is nothing in the record to suggest Ms. Roe will be subjected to retaliatory harm,' Assistant Attorney General David Drummey wrote on behalf of the university.\n",

            "A top justice judge has said that Australian women should have the choice to be paid to be a surrogate mother. Speaking at the University of Queensland in Brisbane on Friday night, Justice Diana Bryant told a room full of journalists that surrogacy laws currently in place need a major overhaul to prevent cases of abandonment. She said she believes that because commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia, hopeful parents are forced to enter into unlawful arrangements overseas. Scroll down for video . A top judge in Brisbane has said that surrogacy laws need to be overhauled to prevent a repeat of the baby Gammy (pictured with his mother) case . 'I personally think we should regulate and allow commercial surrogacy in Australia,' she said. 'If we allow it in Australia, we then can regulate it and ensure that it's done on ethical terms.' Her statement is backed up by a recent bout of child abandonment cases, where parents have  refused to carry through with overseas surrogacy deals. This week an Australian couple were slammed after they left a baby boy born to their Indian surrogate with his mother after she unexpectedly gave birth to twins. Documents revealed the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. Justice Diana Bryant (pictured) has spoken out about Australia's surrogacy laws . The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. They was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. The Indian case is similar to the controversial baby Gammy scenario. Gammy was born in Thailand to a surrogate mother, however after reportedly learning that he had a disability, his Australian parents, West Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell, only brought  his twin sister home with them. The Farnells returned to Australia with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, while Ms Chanbua remained with Gammy in Thailand's Chonburi province. Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender, retained custody of Pipah late last year after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection. Gammy pictures with his Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua during a trip to the beach . In November, WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said there would be 'continual and rigorous testing' of a safety plan that had been developed for Pipah. Following these cases the Thai government  passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services. The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples. Currently in Australia, it is illegal for women to act as surrogates, except in the Northern Territory where there are no laws in place to stop the act. In NSW, ACT and Queensland, arranging a contracted surrogacy overseas is also considered a criminal offence. Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell . 'I think the Government could eliminate some of the worst aspects of international surrogacy by devising some ethical requirements that need to be met before intending parents are permitted to bring a child back into Australia,' Justice Bryant said. Justice Bryant also said Australian surrogacy should be legalised as many of the children who are currently born to surrogates overseas will never get the chance to meet their biological mothers. 'That child is never going to know their biological mother, and in those cases, there is absolutely no opportunity for them ever to find out,' she said. 'The knowing the biological parentage for me would be one of the first steps and I think we have a responsibility as a country to make sure the worse aspects of commercial surrogacy are overcome.'\n",

            "What would high fashion adverts look like if the designers used real women, rather than teenage models or celebrity faces, to showcase their latest clothing and beauty lines? Photo stylist Nathalie Croquet, from Paris, has recreated a series of glossy commercials for her project SPOOF. The exhibition includes parodies of ads from Givenchy, Lancome, Lanvin and Acne. In the images Nathalie has recreated the adverts completely, from the clothes the model wears, to the poses, make-up, hair colour and surroundings. Scroll down for video . Lancome: Nathalie Croquet a photo-stylist from Paris created a photo series called SPOOF in which she recreated the ads of famous designers and brands . Natalie said: 'SPOOF is an artistic project of 11 photos, we did an exhibition in February in Paris with my pictures in a big size. 'I had the idea in October and we worked on it for two months. I have worked in the fashion business as a photo stylist for magazines and advertising for 25 years. 'So I am the person who  has ideas for ad campaigns. It was a strange idea for for me to be on the other side of the camera!' During the course of her career Nathalie has worked with over 200 different photographers on various campaigns. ELEVENPARIS: In this image a smiling Nathalie emulates the pose Kate Moss adopted for the French brand . Lanvin: The series of pictures took two months to create and Nathalie said it was interesting to be on the other side of the camera . Nathalie said that the project helped her to understand her job on a deeper level: 'By changing role I discovered my craft from another angle.' She said that she hoped the humour in the images would provide people with the opportunity for, 'laughter and reflection.' She told Buzzfeed: 'I don’t really see myself. You know, like how you don’t recognize your voice in a telephone message?' Eric Bompard: Just like the real life adverts Nathalie's pictures were retouched, for example her eye colour was changed to blue for this Eric Bompard-inspired  shoot . Acne Studios: Nathalie copied the hair, make-up and poses from the original shots . She continued: 'I feel people need a more spiritual approach to life, and good fun. I’m happy to give them that, even if I’m just making fun of myself.' Daniel Schweizer the photographer who shot the images said: 'Most of the time we look at advertising images without analysis, without fully perceiving the extent that they have been worked on. 'Changed clothes and accessories, digital retouching, skin cleansed, faked decor, body stretched; it is only when we take a closer look at these images that we get the full measure. Their apparent simplicity is the result of a huge job.' Isabel Marant: For this shoot only Nathalie's boots were different from those worn by Gisele Bundchen in the real thing . The brazilian supermodel posed on the floor in this black and white  Isabel Marant advert . For the project Nathalie had her hair and make-up professionally styled so that her look completely resembled that of the famous models in the advertising images. Her make-up was done by Cyril Nesmon whilst Rodolphe Farmer styled her hair. And just like the real adverts the images were retouched by Emilie Holtz and worked on by Alexandre Plicque-Gurlitt. Sonia Rykiel: Nathalie recreates this shot with a similar looking background to the one used in the original . Voltaire: Nathalie says that she hopes that her pictures will make people laugh and reflect .\n",

            "Ronald Koeman is looking forward to this weekend's 'special' match against Tottenham, ahead of which the Southampton manager praised the 'great job' predecessor Mauricio Pochettino did at St Mary's. The former Argentina defender ended a 16-month stint on the south coast last summer to sign a five-year deal at White Hart Lane. Pochettino's exit was the catalyst to an unparalleled talent drain from St Mary's, although successor Koeman has not only steered the club to calmer waters but to new heights. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has praised the work of his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino at the club . Pochettino (left) managed Southampton between 2013 and 2014 before leaving for Tottenham Hotspur . Southampton full-back Nathaniel Clyne (left) tussles for possession with Stoke's Steven Nzonzi (right) Stoke forward Jonathan Walters dribbles ahead of Southampton's Maya Yoshida (right) in their last game . Koeman had to cope with several player sales at Southampton, including Luke Shaw to Manchester United . Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana (right) was also sold to Liverpool shortly after Koeman arrived at the club . With five matches remaining, Saints are just a point and a place worse off than Spurs in sixth and can usurp them in the European spots with victory in Saturday's early kick-off. 'Everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team,' Koeman told reporters. 'But I think the quality of the players that we brought in were good, at a good level. I think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season, to play a good season at a good level. 'Now we are fighting for a high position in the table. There's still five games to play and a very nice one this Saturday afternoon. 'It is Tottenham, the difference is only one point and, okay, for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because Mauricio is now the coach and was the coach of Southampton. 'He is the coach of the opponent this Saturday, so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines.' Koeman was speaking at St Mary's after meeting Barclays Spirit of the Game hero Tina Croucher, who was being rewarded for her community work at the club. The Southampton manager and midfielder Victor Wanyama answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event, where talk of Pochettino was rarely far away. Koeman says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes Saturday's match the biggest at St Mary's since he took the reins. A positive result would see Saints break their record Premier League points haul set last year by Pochettino, although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception. The former Argentina defender's departure left a sour taste with many Southampton fans, whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. 'Sometimes if you go as a Barcelona player to Madrid the reception is difficult, and sometimes in Holland,' Koeman said, when asked if he has such a bad reception. 'But, okay, I think the reception for Mauricio normally has to be good because he did a great job for Southampton. 'I like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact.' Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (centre) shields the ball from Swansea players back in September . There certainly does not appear any bad blood between Koeman and Pochettino, despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the Dutchman an easy job at Southampton. Koeman took those comments in his stride, joking at the time that he only came to Southampton 'to have a nice little holiday'. Now, just days before the game, the Saints boss gave a more serious answer, praising his Spurs counterpart for the legacy he left at St Mary's. 'I think they make the beginning (of this) and developed the quality of the players, the young players,' Koeman said. 'I think the structure and organisation in the team, the spirit of the players starts under Mauricio. 'I took that over and maybe we were different in some details. From what I heard, maybe I try to do more training sessions with the ball and maybe he was a little bit more physical. 'I think the start, for the development of the team, was under Mauricio and he did a great job last season. 'We continue (that) and so far we made it a little bit better than it was, but that is all about the experience and quality of the players.'

            "Teachers complained they are now expected to be 'frontline stormtroppers' in the fight against Islamist extremism in school, a conference has heard. They said they are now being forced to spy on children during sensitive discussions as a result of new-counter terrorism rules. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) suggested that Government strategies designed to tackle extremism and terrorism have instead 'shut down debate' in schools. Teachers said they now feel nervous discussing controversial issues over fears they will be pressured to report youngsters who share their opinions. They also claimed young people  feel unable to express there views on certain subjects, such as the Charlie Hebdo killings, for fear of being branded an extremist. Scroll down for video . Christine Blower, NUT general secretary, said there is a need keep a 'safe space' for discussion . Jan Nielsen, an NUT member from Wandsworth, south-west London, said: 'We have to be clear that we are being put in the position where we are really being expected to be the frontline stormtroopers, who listen, who spy, and notify the authorities about students that we may be suspicious of.' The conference heard an example of a student being pulled aside after prayers one Friday because children coming out of the prayer room were talking about extremism, despite the fact that the boy had put a strong argument against joining jihadi groups. In another case, a boy who applied to go to Pakistan to visit his dying grandfather had his laptop taken from him and searched, with three potential examples of the youngster viewing jihadi websites found. When the pupil was questioned, he asked how he could argue against something if he did not understand it. In response, the pupil's non-Muslim classmates questioned why they would not be seen as suspicious if they applied to visit their grandparents in Holland, the conference was told. Delegates at the annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, raised concerns about the move to require schools to promote fundamental British values as well as the Government's Prevent strategy, which is aimed at tackling extremism. The strategy suggests school staff can help to identify and refer youngsters whose behaviour suggests that they are being drawn into extremism or terrorism. Alex Kenny, of the union's executive, described Prevent as a 'blunt instrument that will do damage and inhibit debate in schools', adding that Ofsted should be allowed 'nowhere near these issues'. Ofsted now checks that schools are actively promoting British values like tolerance and democracy as part of regular inspections. In the wake of attacks on the Charlie Hebdo journalists there were, in some schools, Muslim pupils who did not feel they could say they were offended by the newspapers cartoons . Mr Kenny said: 'We live in a damaged and volatile world, and like us, young people are trying to make sense of it, like us, they're trying to come to conclusions about cause, effect and solutions, and like us they want a space to discuss it. 'Schools are places where that discussion, on ethical and political issues should take place, in an environment of enquiry, and it may be an environment where young people say things we don't like, or say things that concern us that we want to address with them, that we want to discuss with them. 'But Prevent conflates a notion of British values and an elastic notion of non-violent extremism that is shutting down that debate.' He added: 'We have measures to deal with safeguarding, we have child protection measures, we don't need Prevent and we don't need to involve the police as the first instance. 'We are hearing young people telling teachers that they don't want to discuss things, that they don't want to discuss what happened with the Charlie Hebdo shootings, young people who were offended by the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, but saying they don't want to say it in class, they don't want to say it in schools. The conference heard that Prevent was shutting down debate in schools . 'Prevent is shutting down debate and we must oppose it and we must say schools are places where children and teachers should be allowed to discuss these issues.' To loud applause, delegates passed a resolution which includes an amendment calling on conference to confirm it believes 'that schools should be places where young people can discuss events in a spirit of enquiry and openness, and that teachers are well-placed to facilitate such discussions and deal with the expression of unacceptable viewpoints'. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Teaching about the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance and respect for others is part of our promotion of British values, and is at the heart of what every school has to deliver for children. 'We want all schools to promote these values throughout the curriculum, not just as a bulwark against extremism, but as a vital part of preparing young people to get on in life.' He added: 'Our guidance makes it clear that no teacher or school leader should feel unable to talk about difficult or sensitive issues - indeed teaching about fundamental British values actively encourages such discussions - but no-one should be using a school to promote views, opinions or beliefs that discriminate against other people on the basis of their background.'\n",

            "Former US president George H.W. Bush looked in good health on Friday as he accompanied Australian tennis player Roy Emerson at the  U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston, Texas. Bush, 90, fell ill in December and was hospitalized after complaining of shortness of breath. Smiling and enjoying the fresh air, he seemed to be in better spirits. Bush is a fan of Associated Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour 250 events and lives in the Houston Area with his wife Barbara. He and his wife have attended many ATP fundraisers and charity events throughout the years. In good spirits!: Former President George H.W. Bush, seated, arrives just before the quarterfinal match between Jeremy Chardy of France and Kevin Anderson from South Africa was suspended by rain . Roy Emerson, 78, who owns 28 major singles and doubles championships, is also a big fan and makes an annual appearance at the tournament. Both Bush and Emerson enjoyed watching  Kevin Anderson of South Africa battle Jeremy Chardy of France before heavy rains postponed the game. Bush looked in far better shape than he did late last year and three years prior when he was also hospitalized. Bush spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. He was discharged in January 2013, after nearly two months in the hospital. Bush is the oldest living former American president. Because he suffers from Parkinson's disease, he is forced to rely on a scooter or a wheelchair. In attendance: Roy Emerson, 78, who owns 28 major singles and doubles championships, is also a big fan and makes an annual appearance at the tournament .\n",

            "Jenna Bush Hager is pregnant with her second child and revealed the news live on this morning's Today show. The 33-year-old and her husband Henry Hager already have a daughter, Mila, who turns two later this month, and the youngster was on-hand to help her mother announce the family's exciting news. During a segment in which 'adventure correspondent' Jenna was discussing what her 'next adventure' for the show would be, she cut away to a clip of herself pointing to her tummy, asking Mila who was in there, before the toddler told the world that it was her 'baby sissy'. Congrats! Jenna Bush Hager revealed that she is expecting her second daughter with husband Henry Hager live on this morning's Today show . Happy family: The Today correspondent, pictured with husband Henry and their daughter Mila, described parenthood as 'the biggest roller coaster ride there is' 'This is the biggest roller coaster ride there is, having children,' Jenna said of her pregnancy. She added about her daughter's reaction to the news: 'She's excited, she's so cute. She keeps saying baby sissy, baby sissy!' Wearing a fitted purple dress which showed just the tiniest hint of a bump, the Today show correspondent confessed that she is already 20 weeks into her pregnancy, revealing that her second daughter is due in August. Jenna admitted in an interview with People that she has known about the pregnancy for some time, revealing that she and Henry broke the news to her parents, former President George Bush, and former First Lady Laura, the day after Christmas. Luckily it has been an incredibly smooth pregnancy for Jenna, who admitted to the publication that her husband has, on occasion, forgotten that she is carrying a child. 'My husband even said, \"I keep forgetting you’re pregnant!\"' she joked. 'Baby sissy': The 33-year-old asked her one-year-old daughter Mila to help make the announcement to the world . Special role: Jenna revealed that her daughter Mila was thrilled about the idea of becoming a big sister . Surprise: Jenna's fellow Today show hosts were thrilled about her news, and were quick to congratulate the soon-to-be mother-of-two . Jenna's Today co-hosts were thrilled for the soon-to-be mother-of-two, with fellow mother Savannah Guthrie leaping up from her desk to give her congratulatory hug, before the team presented her with a bunch of flowers and some baby clothes. Jenna and Henry, who married in May 2008, welcomed their first daughter, whose full name is Margaret Laura Hager, on April 13, 2012 - and the TV presenter revealed to People that the couple had actually been expecting a boy. 'We didn't find out with Mila and we were convinced she was a boy, to the point that we painted the nursery a pale blue,' she explained. 'And it was a girl! We were thrilled, but shocked. So with the second, we decided to find out.' And it seems as though Jenna is already preparing for the challenges of parenting two young children at once; after Today show executive producer Don Nash tweeted his congratulations to the star, she replied joking that she needed some parenting tips. 'Congrats to @JennaBushHager and Henry on another baby girl on the way! Double the trouble, double the fun! #trustmeiknow (sic)' Don tweeted, prompting Jenna to reply: '@Studio1ADon thanks!! I need parenting tips. Ha. (sic)' Proud mother: The Today show's official 'adventure correspondent' was incredibly excited to reveal her happy news . The big reveal: Shortly after making the announcement, Jenna was showered with hugs and gifts from the Today show team . Grandparents: Jenna and Henry told her parents, former US President George Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush (pictured), about the pregnancy during the Christmas vacation . Jenna's second pregnancy may mean that she has to put her role as the Today show's official adventure correspondent, a position which has seen her take on all manner of weird and wonderful challenges during the past few months, on hold however. And unfortunately for Jenna's adventure-focused fans, that means the expectant mother won't be able to complete any of the four potential viewer-chosen challenges which she was due to face in the next few weeks. More than 50,000 people voted for what daring feat Jenna would complete next, with an incredibly speedy roller coaster ride and parachuting off a bridge taking the lead. 'Some people will do anything to get out of a roller coaster ride,' Matt Lauer joked after hearing the news. Shortly after appearing on the Today show, Jenna took to her Instagram account to once again express her joy at the family's happy news. Alongside a picture of herself posing with husband Henry and Mila, the doting mother commented: 'Feel so lucky that we're adding another precious, precocious little girl to our family. My heart is full.'\n",

            "Incredible pictures have shown the moment ferocious red sandstorms currently engulfing China devoured a city in the country's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance after the fourth massive sandstorm struck the north-west of the country this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. The raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has now issued a blue alert for the latest sandstorms to hit the northern regions. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi, in what was the fourth sandstorm to hit the area this year. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. Police spokesman Hui Chuang said: 'The storm forced most people to stay indoors because it was difficult to drive anyway given the low visibility and also hard to breathe without inhaling sand. 'It also forced the closure of the nearby Mogao Grottoes.' The site is a UNESCO world heritage tourist site renowned for its massive sculptures and frescoes carved in caves along a cliff. Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city yesterday . Traffic was brought to a standstill and residents fled for cover when the storm hit . Two local government officers attempt to sweep the sand off the city's pavements . Cars switched on their lights in order to navigate their way through the billowing sand cloud . A police cruiser makes it way through the traffic amid yesterday's ferocious sandstorm . The colour-coded weather warning system designated the sandstorm blue in an attempt to forewarn residents . Two men look out across the city where visibility was in some areas reduced to 50m .\n",

            "(CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. \"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),\" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. \"It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.\" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. \"We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,\" Mainzer wrote.\n",

            "Michael Owen has warned Raheem Sterling that life after Liverpool may not be all he hopes it to be after the England youngster revealed this week that he had rejected a £100,000-a-week deal at Anfield. Owen, like Sterling, started his senior career at Liverpool but eventually moved on to Real Madrid in 2004. But he says the 20-year-old is not good enough to make the same move to the Spanish capital. Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City are all said to be interested in the hottest property in English football, but Liverpool are determined not to let one of their star players leave, even with his contract expiring at the end of next season. Michael Owen has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool may not be all he hopes it would be . Owen, like Sterling, started his senior career at Liverpool but eventually moved on to Real Madrid . Owen feels that Sterling is in a great place to develop, having done the same during his time at Anfield . Owen feels that Sterling is in a great place to develop, but argues that it doesn't mean the youngster owes the club anything. 'There is no question he (Sterling) has been at the perfect place to learn his trade and he has been managed fantastically well so far,' Owen said. 'But that shouldn't mean he should be indebted to the extent of feeling he owes everything to the club. If the club created top players from nothing then everyone would make it. 'A club is quick to get rid of a player when they don't serve a purpose anymore so why should a player not do what's best for him when the boot is on the other foot?' Owen scored 158 goals during his time at Liverpool, spending eight seasons on Merseyside until 2004 . Owen bursts away from Bruno Ngotty of Bolton Wanderers before he left Liverpool for Real Madrid . Owen left Liverpool for Real Madrid in a £16.8million move in 2004 before later moving on to Newcastle United . Sterling is expected to start for Liverpool in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off against Arsenal after Brendan Rodgers stated his intention to keep hold of the winger. And Owen says that the lack of a place in Real or Barcelona's teams mean that the only move he could make away from Anfield would be a sideways one. Sterling spoke in an interview with the BBC this week about his career ambitions and turning down the deal . The presence of Cristiano Ronaldo and co leave Owen unconvinced that a move to Spain would be right . 'Having watched him closely throughout his professional career, it it is fair to say that his progress has been spectacular,' he wrote on sportlobster. But he is still a notch or two off being \"world class\". 'I don't see what realistic options he has got if a move away from Anfield was on his mind. He wouldn't get into Real Madrid's or Barcelona's teams and any other move surely has to be seen as a move sidewards?'\n",

            "One problem with space travel is that humans aren’t very good at coping with reduced gravity - their bones and muscles deteriorate over time. But one company says they have an answer - a giant rotating space cylinder that can create artificial gravity. Scroll down for video . A Washington, DC-based company called United Space Structures wants to create a new space station. Their giant cylinder (shown, with the ISS and Space Shuttles illustrated) could apparently replace the ISS. It would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity, and would be 1,300ft (400 metres) long, cost £200 billion ($300 billion) and take 30 years to build . The ‘space mushroom’ was designed by Bill Kemp and Ted Maziejka from United Space Structures (USS), based in Washington, DC. The final design would be 330ft (100 metres) in diameter and 1,310ft (400 metres) long. • Orbiting Hotel/Casino/3D Sports Arena . • Orbiting space station - Planetary environmental monitoring/Research . • Solar system space vehicle . • Settlement cargo vehicle & construction platform . • Rescue vehicle . • Continuously looping space ferry system . • Mining vehicle/platform . • Manufacturing platform . • Bio-medical research/manufacturing . Artificial gravity is created by spinning the station 4.22 times per minute around its vertical axis, creating downward pressure via the centrifugal force to keep objects - including humans - on the floor. The force would be the same as the gravity experienced on Earth. Meanwhile on the ISS, the station is in constant freefall towards Earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ‘zero-gravity’. While the main cylindrical body would spin in one direction, the top dome-shaped section would spin in the other direction. This would allow spacecraft to dock with the top of the station, which would appear stationary to them. The necessity for this dome gives the space station its mushroom-like appearance. The dome would house the command centre for the station, and also many of the supplies needed for the crew on board. ‘We believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space,’ Mr Kemp told MailOnline. To build the station, the team says they have ‘patents pending’ for six robotic systems that can manufacture and construct a variety of structures in space. While exact details aren’t known at the moment, another company - Tethers Unlimited -  has demonstrated how structures could be built in space with their SpiderFab proposal, a system of robo-spiders that would build parts of spacecraft in orbit, although Mr Kemp told MailOnline that the USS method would be 'different'. Mr Kemp added that, for this large structure, it would take about 30 years to build and cost close to £200 billion ($300 billion). For comparison, it took more than 10 years to build the ISS, at a cost of around £67 million ($100 billion) - although this new station has 2.89 million times more volume. And it would be ‘large enough to transport all the people and equipment required to set up a colony on Mars and would orbit Mars and provide a safe environment while the Mars base is being constructed.’ Artificial gravity has been considered many times before, most famously in the 'Stanford Torus' design (interior seen here). A rotating station would allow people to live as if they were walking on Earth, allowing them to stay in space for long periods of time . To build the station, something like SpiderFab (left) could be used, a proposed system of robo-spiders than can construct solar panels, trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit. On the right is an artificial gravity test Nasa performed in September 1966. The Gemini 11 spacecraft was attached to an Agena target vehicle and spun, with the astronauts reporting a small amount of artificial gravity in their spacecraft . On the ISS, the station is in constant freefall towards Earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ‘zero-gravity’. However, they actually still experience about 90 per cent of Earth's gravity, but the constant falling makes them seem weightless . Inside, the structures would be spinning so anyone on the curved ‘floors’ around the edges would be pushed into the ground, simulating gravity on Earth. But Mr Kemp said they want to build a smaller structure first, to prove the design works. ‘Our first structure will be 30 metres [100ft] in diameter, it will create a 0.6 gravity environment and would house at least 30 people,’ he said. This smaller structure would cost between £3.5 and £7 billion ($5 and $10 billion), and could be built in the next 10 years. It would take just 12 to 18 months to build, according to Mr Kemp. ‘The International Space Station is estimated to be decommissioned around 2024,’ Mr Kemp noted. The team has yet to begin any serious construction or testing as of yet - so at the moment, the station remains somewhat of a pipe dream. Astronauts on the ISS (Terry Virts seen left, Scott Kelly on the right) live in a constant state of micro-gravity. Mr Kelly is spending a year on the ISS to see what effects such conditions have on the human body for a prolonged period of time . In the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, astronauts are shown running around a spacecraft that spins (shown) while on a mission to deep space, creating artificial gravity for them to operate in . Previous concepts for spacecraft include this 1969 station that would rotate on its central axis to produce artificial gravity. The majority of early space station concepts created artificial gravity one way or another in order to simulate a more natural or familiar environment for the health of the astronauts on board . However, space settlement expert Al Globus, who is also a contract scientist at Nasa's Ames research centre, told MailOnline that he thought the idea was somewhat sound - and artificial gravity was a necessity for prolonged stays in space. ‘Rotation to provide artificial gravity will counteract most, if not all, of the negative effects of micro-g,’ he said. And he says if we truly want to live in space, including raising children there, it will be necessary to create such a station. ‘There is no data on the effects of micro-g on kids, but it is safe to assume they will grow up very weak as muscles and bones develop in response to stress,’ he continued. ‘Thus, for settlement, there is simply no question that they must rotate and almost certainly need to provide 1g at least for the first few generations.’ But whether this station will be the answer remains to be seen. Several other proposals for a rotating space station have been drawn up - including a Nasa concept called Nautilus-X - but as of yet, there are no concrete plans by Nasa, Roscosmos (the Russian space agency) or any other nation on what to do after the ISS. Whether this station by United Space Structures or another concept will be built, remains to be seen. Nasa's Nautilus-X concept, shown, includes a doughtnut-shaped spinning section in the middle where astronauts can experience artificial gravity. The spacecraft is designed for long trips to the moon, Mars or beyond . While a spacecraft could be created with artificial gravity, astronauts will still have to contend with zero-gravity conditions if they ever venture outside into space. Shown are Nasa's Robert L. Curbeam, Jr. (left) and Esa's Christer Fuglesang above New Zealand in 2006 .\n",

            "The heartbroken mother of a unarmed teen who was shot dead by police has revealed the last words her son spoke as he lay dying in an ambulance. Hector Morejon was shot by a Long Beach, California, police officer, who allegedly thought the 19-year-old was pointing a gun at him during a trespassing and vandalism incident. According to her attorney, his mother, Lucia Morejon, was at home when she heard the shots. Lucia Morejon, the heartbroken mother of a unarmed teen who was shot dead by police has revealed the last words her son, Hector Morejon, 19, spoke as he lay dying in an ambulance . She went to an alley near her home to see what happened and then realized it was her son in the ambulance, reports the LA Times. 'When he saw her, he propped himself partially up and cried to her, 'Mommy, Mommy, please come, please come!' ' her attorney's statement said, reports the Press Telegram. 'She walked towards the ambulance, identified herself as his mother, expecting to ride with him to the hospital, but was pushed back by a man in a blue uniform.' Her attorney Sonia Mercado told The Huffington Post: 'He was reaching for her - reaching out to her for help.' 'It's a tough thing to live with as a parent,' said Mercado. 'She is deeply in shock.' Hector Morejon, 19, was shot dead by a police officer on Thursday while in a vacant apartment . The Press Telegram reports that according to the statement, Lucia Morejon asked what happened but was not given any information. It continues: 'At the hospital, Mrs. Mojeron and her family were not allowed to see Hector until he was dead.' In a statement released Monday, the family of Hector Morejon said they are requesting that the LBPD 'immediately release the name and badge number of the officer who is responsible for killing Hector who was unarmed.' Police said officers received a report that several people were trespassing and vandalizing an empty apartment at about 2:45 p.m. Thursday. When they attended they saw there was an open window and a broken window. According to an LBPD press release, an officer looked into the apartment through the broken window and saw a man (later identified as Morejon) standing against a wall. The press release states the officer saw the man turn toward him, while bending his knees and extending his arm out, as if pointing an object which the officer perceived as a gun. The officer then fired, according to police. Morejon,from Long Beach, was initially listed in critical condition, but was later pronounced dead at a hospital. No weapons were found at the scene. 'Objects were collected from the scene, but it has not been yet determined at this point in the investigation if those objects were what the officer observed,' said Sgt. Megan Zabel, a Police Department spokeswoman told the LA Times. 'We are not describing evidentiary detail on what those objects are at this time, as with how many times the suspect was shot.' Police said the apartment was spray-painted with gang-related graffiti. The family reject suggestions that the teen was a gang member. According to a statement from the LBPD to the Long Beach Post, the department 'thoroughly reviews all use of force incidents through a rigorous multi-step process that evaluates legal, policy, tactical and equipment issues. 'In addition, all officer involved shootings where a death occurs, are independently investigated by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.'\n",

            "A five-year-old boy who battled cancer has been given the all clear by doctors - after creating a superhero mask to help him through his treatment. Harley Renshaw was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, neck, lungs and bones. But his Ninja Turtle mask helped him feel stronger while he was having radiotherapy. Hospital staff were amazed when the youngster, from Stretford, asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his treatment. Harley Renshaw has been told he is cancer-free after battling an aggressive form of the disease for a year. He donned a superhero costume during his radiotherapy treatment, to help him feel brave . Harley asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his radiotherapy treatment like a Ninja Turtle . After Harley's story made headlines around the world, staff at children's TV channel Nickelodeon even sent Harley a box full of Ninja Turtle presents for Christmas. And now doctors given Harley's parents Oliver, 25, and Stacey, 23, the news they had not dared to dream of - he is free of cancer. He will undergo regular check-ups over the coming years to make sure he stays free of the disease. Mr Renshaw said: 'We're chuffed to bits. Harley is doing great. It was just over a year ago that he was diagnosed and he has been through it. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time.' Mr and Mrs Renshaw were given Harley's devastating diagnosis after taking him to see a doctor when he complained of a pain in his stomach. He was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare and aggressive childhood cancer which affects fewer than 100 children in the UK. Harley was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, lung, bones and neck after mother Stacey took him to a doctor with a stomach pain . Harley's story became famous after it was reported in the local paper in December last year. The children's TV channel Nickelodean even sent him a whole box of Ninja Turtles presents for Christmas . Neuroblastoma is cancer of specialised nerve cells, which are involved in the development of the nervous system. The tumours usually start in one of the adrenal glands found above the kidneys, or in nerve tissues that run along the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. As in Harley's case, the cancer can also spread to other areas of the body. After doctors diagnosed his tumour, Harley faced 80 days of intensive chemotherapy and an operation to remove his kidney tumour. A month later, he was back at hospital for a stem cell transplant – also called a blood or marrow transplant - where healthy stem cells were injected into his body to replace damaged or diseased stem cells. He suffered complications as a result of the procedure, but battled through them to return home for his fifth birthday. He also had weeks of radiotherapy at The Christie clinic in Manchester. Finally, he and his parents were given the incredible news that he was cancer-free. Harley's father said he is 'so chuffed' his son is cancer-free. 'Harley is doing great,' he said. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time' His bravery caught the attention of doctors in the hospital and he was awarded one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards. He has also become the face of the charity's Kids and Teens Campaign, which aims to raise funds for research into child cancers. Mr Renshaw said Harley's family are overjoyed to be told he is free of cancer. He added: 'We're just really excited and looking forward to the future.' To donate or for more information about Cancer Research UK Kids & Teens visit cruk.org/kidsandteens . Neuroblastoma is a cancer of specialised nerve cells in the nervous system and other tissues. Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with the disease. Most children diagnosed with the disease are younger than five years old. It is the second most common solid tumour in childhood, and it makes up 8 per cent of the total number of children's cancers. Neuroblastoma commonly occurs in either one of the two adrenal glands in a child's tummy or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The cancer can spread to tissues beyond the original site, including bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver and skin. As with most cancers the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. A neuroblastoma cancer cell in the brain is pictured under the microscope. Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with this form of cancer . The symptoms vary depending on where a child's tumour is. The first signs can be vague, and include tiredness, a loss of appetite and pain in the bones. If the tumour is in a child's tummy, it may be swollen and the child may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine. Where a tumour is growing in a child's chest, they may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing. Tumours growing in the neck can be visible as a lump, and a child is likely to complain of breathing and swallowing problems. In cases where a tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children can experience a weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily. A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. Treatment depends on the age of the child, as well as the size and position of the tumour and whether the disease has spread. Children can have surgery, chemotherapy, as well as antibody treatment and radiotherapy. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support .\n",

            "The mother of a missing 15-year-old autistic girl has made a desperate plea for help after her daughter disappeared while out walking a week ago. Teenager Kimberly Greenberg became angry and left her Santa Monica home to calm down about 8.30pm on March 24, but never returned. Her mother Janice Greenberg has now made an urgent appeal for help as the teenager, described  as having the mental capacity of an eight-year-old, has gone missing without her cellphone or medication. Kimberly Greenberg, 15, disappeared more than a week ago after going for a walk near her Santa Monica home . The autistic teenager left her home without medication or her cellphone and has not been seen for a week . She told NBC Los Angeles that she adopted Kimberly eight years ago, and the area they lived in was what the teenager considered her 'safe place'. 'It is the worst thing you could ever imagine happening,' she said. 'Absolutely horrific. There's no getting through the day - there's no explaining it. 'I have to keep faith that she's going to come back,' she told KTLA. A LAPD spokesman said Kimberly was last seen wearing a red sweater, jeans and ugg boots when she left home to go for a walk and calm down at the nearby Mar Vista Recreation Centre. Despite knowing the area and walking there often, she has not been seen since. The spokesman said: 'Kimberly is currently taking medication and her family is extremely concerned. She is described as a 15-year-old Hispanic female with brown hair and brown eyes. She stands 4feet, 10inches tall and weights approximately 110pounds.' Anyone with information about her whereabouts should contact the LAPD, Pacific Division Watch Commander at (310) 482-6371.

Of the ship's 2,117 passengers, 95 have suffered from vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms, the CDC said. The illness has also affected five members of the 964-person crew. The CDC has yet to determine what's causing the ailments. Two staffers from the agency are scheduled to meet the West Coast-based ship in San Diego on Monday. The Infinity left San Diego on March 29. It made its last stop in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on April 10, according to MarineTraffic.com. Celebrity Cruises has been taking action since the outbreak began, including increasing cleaning and disinfection procedures, keeping passengers informed and taking specimens from the afflicted for testing by the CDC, the agency says. According to the Maritime Executive, this is the third time the Celebrity Infinity has suffered an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness, with others occurring in 2006 and 2013.

            "The surviving daughters of a mother who has been imprisoned for strangling six of her children to death moments after they were born are standing by their murderous mom. Megan Huntsman, 40, is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to killing the six newborns, then stashing their bodies in the garage of her home in Pleasant Grove, Utah. A judge today handed Huntsman six sentences of five years to life - but family members rallied round her even as her 'cold and calculated' crimes were recounted to the court. Scroll down for video . Prison: Megan Huntsman, 40, was today given six terms of five years to life in prison after admitting the murders. Three will run consecutively, which means she will spend at least 15 years in prison - and likely much longer. She is pictured today in court . Grisly: Investigators are shown above searching Huntsman's garage, where a total of seven baby corpses were found in cardboard boxes. One of the children was stillborn - Huntsman strangled the rest . Huntsman, a meth addict, told police that she started killing off her children when she got pregnant because her drug problem meant she couldn't care for them. Local reports from the courtroom told how Hunstman's attorney took to the stand and read out letters from two of her daughters, who were born before her addiction began. The letters drew a stark contrast between the loving mother they say they knew, and the type of woman who would kill her own flesh and blood on six different occasions. Her mother, Joyce Huntsman, was reportedly in court - and took the stand to tearfully defend her daughter despite the heinous crimes. Discovery: Hunstman, left, was arrested after her estranged husband Darren West, right, found the bodies in her garage. West, who previously served time in prison, is not considered a suspect in their deaths . Scene: Her estranged husband found one of the babies' bodies while cleaning out the garage at her Pleasent Grove, Utah home, pictured, in April last year . She told the court that the woman who committed the crimes was 'not my Megan'. According to the KSL local news station, a detective recounted Huntsman's cold and deliberate method of execution. Unwitting: West, pictured after the sentencing, is thought not have known nothing about the murders . The officer said Huntsman told she would take the babies in her hands when they were just minutes old. Then, he said, she would press on their necks with her thumbs until they choked to death. She would then put their tiny bodies in . Ultimately the corpses of seven babies were found - one of which was determined to have been stillborn. The crimes were uncovered by Huntsman's husband Darren West - now estranged - who called police when he found the first body. The births and murders are said to have taken place from 1996 to 2006. According to stunned neighbors when she was arrested, Huntsman was 'perpetually slim' and they would never have suspected she was pregnant. The sentences handed down to Huntsman today were the maximum possible for her crimes. Three of them will be served consecutively - meaning she will spend a minimum of 15 years inside, and likely much longer. The sentence brings closure to a case that sent shockwaves through the quiet, mostly Mormon community where Huntsman stored the tiny bodies for more than a decade. The small city of Pleasant Grove is south of Salt Lake City.\n",

            "Oskar Groening (pictured earlier in the hearing) is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted . An Auschwitz survivor who lost 49 family members in the Holocaust says the fact that a 93-year-old former guard at the death camp is on trial is more important than any punishment. Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, who lost her parents and sister, told the Lueneburg state court today that seeing former SS officer Oskar Groening in court is 'a kind of satisfaction.' The 89-year-old says she could never have imagined she would be testifying before a German court and that 'for me it's not about the punishment', the DPA news agency reported. Her comments come after another Holocaust survivor angered her fellow plaintiffs by forgiving Groening - known as the 'bookkeeper of death' - and said he should not be prosecuted. Eva Mozes Kor, 81, who publicly embraced Groening in court last week in an extraordinary act of forgiveness, called for the trial to end. By doing so, she faced criticism from her co-plaintiffs who suggested she should not have taken part in the trial in Germany. Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces a possible three to 15 years if convicted. Prosecutors argue his role sorting prisoners' stolen valuables, to which he admits, helped the death camp function. Mrs Kor made her comments during a television appearance on Sunday discussing the purpose of the trial. She argued that any Nazis still alive should instead come forward to speak publicly about what they did to help counter the threat of neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers in Germany. In response, her co-plaintiffs released a statement through their lawyers yesterday saying: 'Our clients would not comment here – who better than a survivor of Auschwitz knows that everyone needs to find their own way to overcome their suffering – if Mrs Kor did not repeatedly stage her 'forgiveness' publicly. Scroll down for video . Embrace: Seventy years after Auschwitz was liberated, Eva Kor embraced former Nazi guard Oskar Groening . Survivor: Eva Kor spoke of how Josef Mengele stood over her bed and laughed when she was injected with a 'deadly germ' Regret: Groening (pictured) described in chilling detail Wednesday how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and then  led directly into gas chambers . 'The subject of this criminal procedure is NOT that Mr Groening has done anything personally to Mrs Kor or any of the other co-plaintiffs. 'Whether it is Mrs Kor's place to forgive Mr Groening's participation in the murder of her relatives is up to everyone to decide for themselves. 'But if Mrs Kor says 'these prosecutions must stop' then she should not have become a co-plaintiff.' The statement added: 'We cannot forgive Mr Groening his participation in the murder of our relatives and another 299,000 people – especially since he feels free from any legal guilt. 'We want justice and we welcome the resolution that this trial brings.' In court in Luneburg last Wednesday Mrs Kor detailed how she and her twin sister Miriam were forced to endure horrifying medical experiments at Auschwitz by Josef Mengele, known as the 'Angel of Death'. She told the hearing how they evaded being gassed on arrival at the death camp thanks to Mengele's twisted obsession with twins. He experimented on twins in a sickening attempt to develop genetic techniques for Hitler's dream of creating a 'pure' Aryan race. Mengele used 1,500 sets of twins in his experiments, and only an estimated 180 to 250 individuals survived. Despite her ordeal, Mrs Kor found the compassion to forgive her Nazi tormentors - and even unofficially adopted the grandson of SS commander Rudolf Hoess, who oversaw the murder of more than 1 million people at Auschwitz. Liberation: Auschwitz survivors  during the first hours of the concentration camp's liberation in January 1945 . Chilling: A sign over the Auschwitz camp reads 'Arbeit Macht Frei' meaning 'Work makes you free' She spoke after giving evidence against the former Nazi SS guard Groening for his alleged complicity in the murder of 300,000 Hungarian Jewish prisoners at the death camp in the summer of 1944. As a qualified bookkeeper, it was his job to sort and store the Jews' money that the Nazis kept. After giving evidence, she approached and embraced Groening, but added: 'My forgiveness does not absolve the perpetrator from taking responsibility for his actions. Neither does it diminish my need to know what happened there.' She claims Groening was so overwhelmed by her unexpected gesture that he fainted. Asked why she had hugged him, she said it had not been planned and added: 'I wanted to thank him for having some human decency in accepting responsibility for what he has done. 'I was always interested in meeting him face to face because I believe that there is a human interaction that I cannot predict and no one else can predict.' She added: 'I don't forget what they have done to me. But I am not a poor person – I am a victorious woman who has been able to rise above the pain and forgive the Nazis.' Mrs Kor later tweeted: 'I met Oskar Groening, introduced myself reached to shake his hand-he grabbed my arm & fainted-I screamed 4 help. It was a strange reaction!!' Both Mrs Kor's parents and two older sisters were killed at the camp. In 1984 she founded the organization CANDLES (an acronym for 'Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments Survivors'), through which she located 122 other living Mengele twins, as the experiment survivors came to be known.\n",

            "Friends of murdered Indiana University student Hannah Wilson have said she was last seen at the same bar where Lauren Spierer partied before she vanished in 2011. Wilson's body was found in rural Brown County, about 10 miles from the campus, on Friday morning after a night out. Daniel Messel, 49, was arrested hours later and has been charged in her death. Circumstances of her disappearance are 'eerily similar' to the case of 20-year-old Spierer, police told Fox59, and they will be looking into the case again. Spierer vanished after a night out at Kilroy's Sports Bar in Bloomington with a group of friends nearly four years ago. Her body has never been found and no criminal charges have ever been filed. 'Eerily similar': Student Hannah Wilson, left, was found murdered hours after leaving a bar in Bloomington, Indiana last week - nearly four years after Lauren Spierer, right, vanished after leaving the same bar . On Monday, Wilson's friends said she had been partying in downtown Bloomington  and they were also going to go to Kilroy's Sports Bar, but deemed that she was too drunk to join them there. The group put Wilson into a taxi alone around 1am on Friday and gave the driver her address. Her body was found near Lake Lemon at around 8.30am. She died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to the county coroner, and preliminary results of an autopsy show she was struck three or four times in the back of the head with an object. Her only other injuries were superficial abrasions and bruises that the coroner said were protective, rather than defensive, wounds. 'Like trying to prevent her head from being hit,' he told The Herald-Times. Wilson was found fully clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault, police told Sky News. Toxicology reports for the woman will not be available for ten to 14 days. Police said they traced a cellphone found near Wilson's feet to Daniel Messel and after they arrested him, investigators found blood in his vehicle, according to a probable cause affidavit. Arrested: Daniel Messel, 49, has been arrested on suspicion of her murder. A cellphone that police traced back to Messel was found at Wilson's feet and investigators allegedly found blood inside his vehicle . Last seen: Her friends went to this bar in Bloomington but, thinking that Wilson was too drunk, put her in a taxi to go home. Spierer also spent time at the same bar before she vanished in 2011 . Messel's stepfather, Gerald Messel, told Fox59 that the man spoke of meeting a girl called 'Hannah' at bars near the university campus ahead of her death. Gerald Messel, who lives with his stepson, said he was surprised when the man failed to come home on Thursday evening and he failed to go to work the next day. When Daniel Messel arrived back home, he was arrested by police, he said. Troopers have confiscated his computer, phone and vehicle. This is also not Messel's first run in with the police, according the the Indiana Daily Student. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and endangering persons in 1995. A year later, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for battery by means of a deadly weapon and battery resulting in serious bodily injury. The president of the Panhellenic Association at Indiana University has organized a fund will go towards providing one full year of room and board for Wilson's sister (above Wilson pictured with her father) Wilson, originally from Fishers, Indiana, was a senior studying psychology at the university. Friends held multiple vigils for the beloved student over the weekend. In one of the vigils, around 1,500 students comforted each other as they assembled on Saturday evening at the campus' Alumni Hall. Balloons were released from the building's solarium by her Gamma Phi Beta sorority sisters. Wilson's mother and sister were present at the memorial and were shielded by family and friends who shared fond memories of her, according to the Indy Star. Indiana University spokesman Mark Land said 'the entire IU Bloomington community mourns the tragic death of Hannah Wilson.' 'Our deepest sympathies go out to Hannah's family and friends during this unspeakably sad time,' he said in a statement. 'She was the kind of girl who made everybody feel special,' Maggie Hadley, one of Wilson's former Indiana Elite teammates told The Indianapolis Star.      H . Heartbroken: Thousands of students assembled on Saturday evening at Indiana University's Alumni Hall for an emotional vigil to remember the beloved 22-year-old student . Sadness: Students comfort each other at the Saturday evening vigil, a day after Hannah's body was found . The president of the Panhellenic Association at Indiana University, Margaret Hensley, has also organized a You Caring fund following the news of Wilson's death. The fund will go towards providing one full year of room and board for Wilson's sister. So far, the fund has collected $5,025 in donations. Hensley wrote: 'We have suffered a tragic loss within our community this past weekend, with the horrifying death of Hannah Wilson. Hannah was a beloved Gamma Phi Beta, psychology major, and bright personality. 'Her younger sister, Haley, is planning on attending Indiana University next year. We as a community want to welcome her with open arms, and feel that creating this college fund for her would be the best method. '24,000 dollars would pay for one full year of room and board for Haley. We hope this could aid the Wilson family in this difficult transition and allow Haley to feel welcome into our Bloomington community.'\n",

            "If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don’t blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.\n",

            "(CNN)Silent, almost shy as she headed into Manhattan Criminal Court, Ailina Tsarnaeva was anything but timid when it came to a perceived rival, prosecutors say. According to a criminal complaint, Tsarnaeva threatened a woman in a phone call this summer, saying \"Leave my man alone.\" \"Stop looking for him. ... I know people that can put a bomb where you live,\" she said, according to the complaint. Considering who was making the threats, prosecutors didn't consider it a joke and charged Tsarnaeva with aggravated harassment, which she denies. Leaving court last December, she and her lawyer refused to discuss the case. Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar, who is now on trial. Tsarnaev's lawyers don't dispute that he did it. The defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older, self-radicalized brother to commit acts of terror. Defense rests in Boston Marathon bombing trial . The Tsarnaev family first immigrated to the Boston area back in 2002. The parents, fleeing a troubled region of Russia, were treated as legal residents and granted asylum -- a status that opened the door for taxpayer-funded welfare. The state of Massachusetts has confirmed the Tsarnaevs received food stamps, public housing and other aid, on and off, between 2002 and 2012. During this time, Tamerlan Tsarnaev began his conversion to radical Islam. Then, according to investigators, he began filling his younger brother's head with a hatred toward the West. Not much is known about the two Tsarnaeva daughters, Ailina, 24, and Bella, 26, though their last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey. Along with charges of making bomb threats, Ailina Tsarnaeva has a past record that includes misleading police in a counterfeiting case. She pleaded guilty but got no jail time. She was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident, but that charge was dismissed. Her older sister, Bella, was charged with marijuana possession and intent to distribute after a 2012 arrest, and she entered a pretrial intervention program. Even their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, has had issues with the law. She fled back to Russia in 2012, where she remains a fugitive. Records show that she was arrested in June 2012 for allegedly shoplifting $1,600 worth of women's clothing from a Boston-area Lord & Taylor department store. She is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. Russia raised concerns to U.S. authorities about her in 2011 at the same time they asked the United States about her son Tamerlan, several sources told CNN shortly after the 2013 attack. U.S. authorities added the mother and son to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- a collection of more than a half-million names maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an intelligence official said. FBI agents interviewed Zubeidat Tsarnaev as part of the investigation into her son, whose case was closed after several months. The radicalization of Tsarnaev . In Russia, she has maintained her innocence in the shoplifting case while also calling the charges against her sons \"made up.\" Though not elaborating on her beliefs, Ailina Tsarnaeva has said she believes, as her mother does, that her surviving brother Dzhokhar and her dead brother Tamerlan are innocent. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 21, faces 30 criminal counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction causing death. On Tuesday, one day after federal prosecutors rested after calling more than 90 witnesses, defense lawyers rested their case without calling Tsarnaev to the stand. Closing arguments are expected Monday. Tsarnaev attorney: 'It was him' Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET. For the latest from Erin Burnett click here.\n",

            "Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with an air defence missile system which could be used to protect nuclear sites. Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the S-300 missile equipment ‘promptly’. The move is likely to anger both the U.S. and Israel at a time of heightened tensions between the world powers and following a landmark deal on nuclear weapons. Moscow blocked deliveries of the surface to air missiles to Iran in 2010 after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme, barring hi-tech weapons sales. Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with the air defence S-300 missile system (above), which could be used to protect nuclear sites . But the Russian president lifted the ban after Tehran struck an interim deal with Britain and five other countries to curb nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework deal, reached this month, intended to significantly restrict Iran’s ability to produce nuclear weapons, while giving it relief from international sanctions. The negotiations have been heavily criticised by Israel which has warned against Iran having any nuclear activities. Russia signed the £545million ($800m) contract to sell Iran the S-300 missile system in 2007, but later suspended their delivery because of strong objections from the U.S. and Israel. Vladimir Putin (above) gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the  equipment . The contract to deliver the system was heavily criticised by Israel and the U.S., who feared it could be used to protect Iranian nuclear sites. When it was cancelled, Iran filed a lawsuit with a court in Geneva, seeking £2.7billion ($4bn) in damages for breach of contract, but the court has not yet issued a ruling. Moscow said it had no choice but to annul the deal when the UN imposed sanctions, outlawing the sale of advanced weapons. Despite the sanctions, Russia and Iran have remained close allies. The deal on Iran’s suspected nuclear activities is supposed to be finalised by June 30. There is no firm agreement on how or when to lift the current sanctions. The announcement comes as the U.S. slammed Russia for flying a fighter jet close to a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an ‘unsafe and unprofessional manner’ last week. Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said the U.S. was filing a complaint to Russia after the incident over the Baltic Sea, in the international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot’s action were ‘unsafe and professional due to the aggressive manoeuvres it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed’, Mr Wright added. Russian officials reportedly denied their pilot did anything wrong. The incident was not first time the U.S. protested to Moscow what it considered to be an unsafe intercept. Last April, a Russian fighter jet intercepted a US reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk.\n",

            "A fiery stoush has erupted between the chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's media empire in Australia and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss. During a tumultuous day of proceedings at a corporate tax inquiry in Sydney today, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator and party leader Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper operates as a business when it is not profitable. When Mr Clarke defended the newspaper as the 'finest national newspaper operating in Australia', Ms Milne flatly told the inquiry, 'you and I won't agree on that'. 'You're a minority,' Mr Clarke fired back. 'Not from the number of people who buy your newspaper,' Ms Milne responded. Scroll down for video . A fiery stoush erupted News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss . Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper continued to when it is not profitable . As Christine Milne made her opinion about The Australian newspaper clear, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke fired back: 'You're a minority' 'Not according to sales,' Greens Senator Christine Milne responded . 'I'm sorry?' Mr Clarke asked. 'How many do we sell a day? 'You sell a very small number,' Ms Milne responded. Mr Clarke also rejected allegations recently published by Fairfax Media alleging $4.5 billion had been siphoned from Mr Murdoch's Australian operations to the United States virtually tax free. He told the hearing the report was 'hopelessly wrong', arguing the stories were 'either deliberately misleading or no idea; looking at the author (business correspondent Michael West), I would say both'. In her questioning, Ms Milne also alleged The Australian was run for ideological purposes. Mr Clarke, who argued the paper examined policy, accepted her contention. It has been previously reported that the national broadsheet lost $30 million in the 2012/13 financial year. The paper was reportedly hoping to half that loss in the 2013/14 financial year. Also at Wednesday's hearing, the inquiry panel heard that the Australian arms of technology giants Google, Apple and Microsoft are being audited by the Australian Tax Office. Google Australia's managing director Maile Carnegie (centre), Microsoft's Bill Semple and Apple Australia Vice President Tony King are pictured fronting today's inquiry . Google Australia's managing director Maile Carnegie (left), Apple Australia Vice President Tony King  and Microsoft's Bill Semple appear at the inquiry . Committee chair Sam Dastyari is pictured listening on as the three tech giants argued their case before the inquiry . Executives from the three major companies confirmed that they were being investigated. Google Australia managing director Maile Carnegie said the company made $58 million in revenue in 2013, and profits of just more than $46 million, but paid $7.1 million in tax. Earlier, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan continued to refuse to reveal the identities of a number of companies suspected of avoiding tax by shifting billions of dollars offshore. Committee chairman Sam Dastyari had written to Mr Jordan on Tuesday requesting he reveal the names. But Mr Jordan refused, and in a response sent to Senator Dastyari and tabled at the hearing on Wednesday, defended the decision on the grounds that naming the companies would undermine public confidence in the tax system. 'The Treasurer has been consulted about making these PII (public interest immunity) claims, and has endorsed them being made by me as an independent statutory office holder. The grounds of the PII claim are as follows,' the letter said. 'Disclosure of the information will have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient operations of the ATO, contrary to the public interest.'\n",

The Crystal Palace manager insists he is happy with current Eagles No 1 goalkeeper Julian Speroni . ‘There’s been no contact between me, Newcastle, the player and the agent,’ Pardew said. ‘I’m surprised at that. It’s unwelcome. I’ve got a great relationship with my goalkeeper here. I’m confident that Krul will stay at Newcastle. ‘We’re looking at a number of players for the future but not a goalkeeper at the moment. We need to take the next step. We’re fortunate of the location we have and the crowd we get.

            "(CNN)In a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in Haiti in 2010, a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on Earth today. The latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9, which would actually makes it about 40% larger than the 7.8 currently being reported. That's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934, which killed around 10,000 people. Unfortunately, it is quite possible the number of dead in Kathmandu could rise to match it. We knew this disaster was coming eventually. Geophysicists have long monitored how fast the Earth's plates are moving, and we know that the entire subcontinent of India is being driven slowly but surely underneath Nepal and Tibet at a speed of around 1.8 inches per year. It's the reason Everest exists. Latest updates on Nepal earthquake . Over millions of years, the squeezing has crushed the Himalayas like a concertina, raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from Pakistan to Burma. Saturday's quake was neither unusual nor unexpected, although it was larger than most. In the 81 years since the 1934 Bihar earthquake, the land mass of India has been pushed about 12 feet into Nepal. Think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under Nepal. The spring is stuck on a broad, rough surface which we call a fault plane (a fault line is what we see when it emerges from the ground). Fallen: Nepal's historic landmarks . Sometimes, energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically, releasing all that pent-up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area. The bigger the area that slips, and the larger the pent-up energy, the greater the damage. Saturday's slip took place over an area about 1,000 to 2,000 square miles over a zone spanning the cities of Kathmandu and Pokhara in one direction, and almost the entire Himalaya mountain width in the other. A part of India slid about one to 10 feet northwards and underneath Nepal in a matter of seconds. We have this kind of detailed data thanks to major advances in seismology over recent years. Using measurements of shaking recorded on seismometers scattered across the world and sent in near or real time to agencies like the U.S. Geological Survey and to universities such as Columbia, we can infer the location and magnitude of a big earthquake very quickly. Avalanches hamper Everest rescue efforts . Not just that: we can now estimate the pattern and speed of rapid sliding across its fault surface. What used to take months of careful academic study now takes minutes of computation. In Haiti in 2010, although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than Saturday's, well over 100,000 people are thought to have been killed around Port-au-Prince by the shaking and its after-effects. Yet despite some differences, the Nepal and Haiti earthquakes also share similarities -- both geological events were known to be approaching, and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty, rapid increases in population in urban areas, uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes. About 1.45 million people live in  Kathmandu, the majority in poorly constructed homes not designed to withstand the kind of shaking seen on Saturday. Nepal has a per capita income of around $1,350, only a notch above that of Haiti, and among the lowest in the world. Meeting building codes in new construction, or taking on expensive retrofitting, is way beyond the means of most. To make matters worse, the valley itself appears to focus the destructive shaking of earthquake waves. Studies have long predicted that the Kathmandu area was due a magnitude-8 earthquake, or higher -- one study predicted between 21,000 and 42,000 fatalities if a magnitude-8.1 earthquake had struck the area. (Fortunately, Saturday's shaking was half that intensity). Still, this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for Nepal as it emerges from a long-running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily. We have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead.\n",

            "(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. \"This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,\" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. \"It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts.\" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

The beautiful DJ, 27, from east London, has worked with and modelled for a variety of fashion and beauty brands including Illamasqua and Boy London - made famous by megastar Rihanna. But now she's speaking out about the decision to start taking female hormones to live as a woman in the hope it will help other transgender teens. Scroll down for video . Munroe Bergdorf, the super sexy brunette as she looks now (left) and in 1999 when she was still a boy called Ian (right) Transgender Munroe has made a name for herself on London's party scene and now spins the decks in some of the country's most high end clubs . Munroe said: 'I had always known growing up that I was supposed to be a woman, but I'd always tried to hide it for fear of being different. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate. 'But I remember being about 17 and wondering how different my life would be if I didn't care what people think. 'It was then that it suddenly hit me - it was time to start being true to myself,' she said. 'I came out as gay to begin with at 15 and then I started dressing up as a woman and doing drag around three years later,' said Munroe. 'Soon I started the slow process to transition into a woman, it was the best decision I've ever made. Now (left) and then (right): Munroe has transformed into a sexy beauty after growing up as a boy. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate,' she says . Munroe (pictured at a party last year) began her transition at the age of 19, and at 25 years old was offered hormones by her doctor . 'I'm now a DJ full time and I do some work within the fashion industry too,' said Munroe. 'I've worked for Calvin Klein in their press office, designed a lip gloss for Illamasqua, a make-up brand that I love, and I've even designed capsule lines for Boy London - Rihanna has worn one of my pieces. 'I also do a bit of modelling from time to time. 'Some people notice that I was once a boy, some people don't - but I'm happy to talk about it if they ask.' Munroe began living as a woman at the age of 18 and started taking drugs friends had been prescribed at 23. It was only at 25 she was offered the hormones by her doctor.

'It is not something that I would recommend at all, but the process can take such a long time, and once you've made the decision to become the person you really are, you just want to get on with it. 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change - and soon as I was given them by my doctor. 'It's like going through puberty again so I got quite self-conscious about the way I looked and dressed, and I felt as though I started to think differently.' 'I didn't really like explaining what was going on to people as I was doing this for myself, but friends and family were curious,' she said. 'My mum found out what was going on when she noticed my chest growing - it was a shock at first but she's very supportive. 'As soon as I noticed the change in myself it was like I wasn't ashamed any more,' she said. Munroe has now been taking hormones for four years, and has embraced her new life. She said: 'When I left university I got involved in fashion and the PR industry. 'I've had the opportunity of working with some incredible brands, designers and photographers, and I just love it.

            "Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned Theo Walcott’s confidence is plummeting after his struggles with England this week. The Arsenal manager will have a heart-to-heart chat with the forward ahead of Saturday’s crunch top-four clash against Liverpool. Walcott was hauled off after 55 minutes of England’s 1-1 draw in Italy on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott struggled for England and Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned by the winger's confidence . Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday . 2 - Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool’s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: ‘Yes, I’m worried about Theo’s confidence. He’s sensitive and I’m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt . ‘He’s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. ‘At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. ‘I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask “how did it go?”. We always speak about the last game. ‘He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. ‘He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. ‘He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.’ Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin — a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. ‘Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,’ said Wenger. ‘Theo’s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He’s not a guy who provides. ‘I don’t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It’s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. ‘I didn’t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say “Walcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front”. That’s an initiative they took on the pitch.’ Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12. Dyke believes increasing the number of British players in squads will help contribute to a more successful England team. But Wenger said: ‘I believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth. ‘Secondly, I’m happy to, and would like to contribute to the quality of the English national team, but you have two questions you can raise before that. ‘First of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in England and it didn’t improve too much the performances of the national team. ‘Secondly, if between the ages of 16 and 21 the England youth teams win every single competition in Europe then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level. Wenger believes there are flaws in FA Chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the homegrown quota . ‘That is not the case, on the contrary. I think between 16 and 21 the English youth teams, until now, have not performed. So that’s the heart of the problem. ‘Let’s get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. ‘I think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high. I still believe when they are good enough, they play. ‘You speak about Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Nobody stops the quality, no matter where they are from. So let’s focus on that first.’\n",

            "(CNN)Fast-food outlet Burger King will sponsor the wedding of an Illinois couple. Not just any couple -- these are the nuptials of Joel Burger and Ashley King. They accepted the restaurant chain's offer to pay for their July affair on Monday. \"We are very appreciative of Burger King and can't thank them enough for their generosity!\" said King. It all started after their engagement in October. The couple had a little fun with the name coincidence and posed by a Burger King restaurant sign for a photo. They were interviewed by reporter Dave Bakke of the State Journal-Register in Springfield, the state capital. Burger King got wind of the article and was immediately interested in the happy couple, tweeting for help to locate them. They were invited on Skype on Monday to learn of a surprise: Burger King will pay for their whole wedding. \"We were shocked (and still are),\" said King. The fast food romance was many years in the making. Burger, now 24, and King, 23, met in kindergarten and grew up together in New Berlin. In fifth grade, classmates Joel Burger and Ashley King were asked to stand as student council representatives during an assembly with a motivational speaker. \"He said our names to the school,\" King told CNN, \"and then laughed and pronounced that together we were Burger King.\" The motivational speaker wasn't too far off -- a merger was in the works. The two became friends by high school, then dated in college. When the time came to propose, \"Joel took me out on his boat to go fishing, and he popped the question while we were on the water.\" Burger King's message for the happy couple: \"Congratulations, Joel and Ashley on falling in love your way.\"\n",

            "The son of the Canadian Consul General in Miami is behind bars after a gunfight erupted on Monday, and her other son is dead. Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, has been arrested for felony murder and his brother Jean, 17, was shot dead after an incident in which the two reportedly tried to rob a group of Miami drug dealers. Their mother is Roxanne Dubé, who was only recently appointed to the role of consul general in Miami. Scroll down for video . Jean Wabafiyebazu (left) was killed and his brother Marc (right) has been arrested after a gunfight erupted during a drug deal on Monday . Their mother is Roxanne Dubé (above), the recently appointed Canadian Consul General in Miami . According to the Miami Herald, police believe the two young men were armed with guns as they tried to rob a group of men during a drug deal at a home in the Coral Way area. The boys had reportedly agreed to purchase two pounds of marijuana at a cost of $5,000, and driven to the house under the guise of making said purchase in their mother's BMW with diplomatic plates. Police claim that their plan was to then rob the drug dealers. Gunfire broke out soon after they entered, and Jean and Joshua Wright were killed, while Anthony Rodriguez was wounded. Marc was in the car when this incident occurred. Both Marc and Rodriguez were arrested under a Florida law that says anyone who participates in a violent felony that results in death can be charged with murder. Rodriguez has also been charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell. A second man was reportedly with Jean when he went to rob the drug dealers, though his identity is not known at this time. Anthony Rodriguez (above) was arrested on charges of felony murder and drug possession . The boys had driven to a house (above) with a third friend to reportedly purchase two pounds of marijuana for $5,000 . Gunfire erupted soon after they entered, though Marc was in the car at the time . Dubé was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. The boys’ father, Germano Wabafiyebazu, told Global News that he does not think Marc had anything to do with this tragedy, and that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life. 'My wife told me they didn’t go out,' he said. 'They went to school, went home, went to school.' Police are still trying to figure out how and where the young men got their weapons.\n",

            "Horticulturalists have urged people to halt the 'grey sprawl' in Britain which is seeing grass and flowers in front gardens replaced by concrete. More than 7million front lawns in Britain have now been paved over - raising the risk of flooding and reducing available habitats for wildlife. And there are not just environmental consequences of replacing grass and wild flowers with brick, as the sight of a green garden is said to boost people's mood. More than 7million gardens in Britain have now been paved over and the RHS is calling for people to plant hedges, trees and flowers to turn the UK green again - as grassy well kept gardens boost mood . The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is calling on people to plant trees, shrubs, climbers, hedges or flowers to attract wildlife, improve air quality and reduce urban temperatures and the risk of flooding. Alistair Griffiths, RHS director of science and collections, said: 'Many of us get a boost by simply looking at a beautiful garden or having access to green space. 'So instead of paving over green we can all play a part in reducing the grey and brightening it, and us, up with some plants. 'On top of making us feel better and happier, if hundreds and thousands of people across the country across the country grew more plants of different varieties in gardens and community spaces, it would all help to improve our air quality, benefit us, our wildlife and reduce temperatures and flooding risks. The society has issued advise for people to transform their gardens by planting a tree, hedge and a shrub . The RHS has launched a three year 'greening grey Britain' campaign in a bid to transform 6,000 unloved grey, concrete spaces into planted-up areas. A survey of 2,000 people by the organisation found that 95 per cent thought being in a beautiful garden lifted their mood. More than 60 per cent said looking at a street of paved-over front gardens saddened them. The RHS says replace paving with plants . The RHS has suggested people can transform their concrete front gardens by planting five things; . a tree - intercept intense rain and slow run-off, helping reduce risk of floods . a hedge - provide areas of shade . a shrub - create extra habitats for wildlife which can promote growing of more plants . a climber - cool buildings . a perennial plant - reduce pressure on drains which can lead to flash flooding . The poll also found that 60 per cent of people worry about paved front gardens and flooding. The society is offering tips on how to transform grey areas. Tips include pulling up a paving stone and planting it up, to creating window boxes and planting trees and climbers in front gardens which can cool buildings. Around 30,000 volunteers who worked on the Britain in Bloom competition will also help transform concrete Britain into a greener space in the three years of the campaign.\n",

            "Former paramedic Crsity Collins had admitted that she used ice while driving and treating patients in an effort to raise awareness about the damaging drug . A former ice addict, who worked as a paramedic while high on the drug, has made her story public in an attempt to raise awareness of the illegal substance and the lack of support available for its victims. Crsity Collins was using crystal meth every day and spending up to $500 a week to keep up her drug habit. The 30-year-old, who took herself to the emergency room six times while suffering drug induced psychosis, has slammed health services for failing to offer her support despite claiming on numerous occasions that bugs were eating her eyes. 'Because I was awake all the time I had a staph infection, but I actually believed I might have bugs in my eyes and when I went to hospital, I was having drug-induced psychosis, I would say I had mites in my eyes or fleas or bugs, ' Ms Collins told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not once was I ever asked \"are you on meth or taking drugs or are you having a drug induced psychosis\" or \"should we get a social worker or a psych assessment\". 'I don't know if they were trying to protect me because I was in the ambulance service, but either way they shouldn't have been protecting me because firstly, I was dealing with people and patients and secondly, like anyone else I deserve the best treatment and care. 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor.' The 30-year-old said she was never offered support despite checking herself into the emergency room on six occasions (right) while claiming that she had bugs in her eyes (left) 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor,' she said . Ms Collins, whose addiction was fuelled by her post traumatic stress disorder and a borderline personality disorder, first began using illegal drugs recreationally, and first tried meth, while living in Darwin. However her habit ironically escalated when she attempted to escape the city an its 'party scene' by moving back to Launceston in Tasmania, where she rekindled a relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was part of 'the same sort of scene'. 'I didn't have any friends that weren't using drugs. Everyone had it around. Pills weren't easy to come across in Launceston, it was always speed and then ice took over,' Ms Collins said. 'It made me feel like superwoman - I could do anything and run on barely any sleep, so it became something I was using on a very frequent basis. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had.' Ms Collins has now been clean for nine months after seeking help from the Department of Veterans Affairs . She said that it was when she and her now ex-boyfriend broke up that she became a daily user of the drug, even when driving and treating patients as an ambulance worker, but that none of her colleagues appeared to notice. 'I never felt affected. I never had any close calls where I could have put someone in danger. I was always very good at my job, very on the ball with patient care, and that why I was never suspected,' Ms Collins said. 'When I look back, I find it absolutely disgraceful. I could have had psychosis at any stage or changed my awareness or sense of judgement - it's such an unpredictable drug. 'I'd hate to know that anyone I know was being taken care of by someone that is hungover or on any form of drug that would alter their sense of awareness, let alone ice. 'But it wasn't until I started taking lots of sick days because my eyes were flaring-up form being awake all the time that anyone noticed something was wrong, and even then it was like they were more worried that I wouldn't have any leave left rather than that my health was deteriorating.' Sores from obsessive picking: She said that traking the drug used to make her feel 'like superwoman' Ms Collins has now been clean for more than nine months after finding free help with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which she was directed to by pure chance after being arrested. 'I was on my way to a dealer's house and got pulled over. My car was raided and they found drugs and when then let me out on bail to appear at court, a police officer who was a reservist said \"you need to get yourself together\" and told me to see Veterans Affairs,' she said. Unlike at the single out-patient facility in Launceston, which was run by nurses and social workers but had no councillors, Ms Collins found intensive help that assessed the root of her drug addiction and uncovered her mental health problems. She now has effective strategies in place with her councillor to deal with her borderline personality disorder and anxiety, which used to lead her to take drugs as a coping mechanism, as well as the post-traumatic stress disorder she acquired while working in Iraq as a medic for six months. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had,' Ms Collins said . 'I was partially stressed [while in Iraq] because I was the only female in that group, so I didn't want to make mistakes and I wanted to fit in with the men,' she said. 'Then there was the constant artillery and bombings we'd get in the compound… it didn't feel like it affected me there, but when I came back I would hear loud bands and instantly hide or duck for cover. I'd be constantly looking for bombs on the side of the roads, it was a habit there and when I got home I couldn't get out of it.' She is not living with her family who provide her with emotional and finical support after she left her job and isolated herself from damaging social groups, and is actively looking for her next line of work. Ms Collins wants to use her story to raise awareness about the 'epidemic of ice users' in Tasmania, where she said middle and higher class users were very common . 'In Tasmania there is becoming an epidemic of ice users and ice related crime, so if it can help even just a few people, then I'm more than happy to share my story,' she said. 'It's not just the lower socio-economic groups in society that we should concentrate on, it's happening everywhere - the drug doesn't discriminate and it's happening in the higher class and the middle classes. You need to have money to use it. 'There's no drug testing in people that we hold in high regards, like paramedics, police and firies - pilots have to have drug tests and paramedics should be made to have these tests too.'\n",

            "A Lithuanian talk show has accused Norway of stealing their children in an attempt to tackle 'the highest rate of inbreeding in the  world'. The episode of An Hour with Ruta, which aired on independent TV channel LNK last week, claimed that foreign children were being seized and fostered with Norwegian parents to strengthen the Nordic country's 'genetic material.' An introduction to the chat show argued that Norway's Child Protection Service (Barnevernet) argued that it was deliberately targeting Lithuanian children which were seen as a 'sought-after commodity'. Lithuanian talk show An Hour with Ruta (pictured) has accused Norway of stealing their children in an attempt to tackle 'the highest rate of inbreeding in the world' It stated that 'In Norway, Lithuanian children are taken away from their parents.' An 'expert' on the controversial service told show host Rūta Mikelkevičiūte that the country needed fresh blood to combat its rates of inbreeding which she said had led to high rates of babies being born with birth defects. Neringa Ozolina, a Lithuanian based in Ålesund, said: 'The birth rate is the lowest in Norway,' according to a report by The Local. Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gražina Leščinskiene (pictured) hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service . 'Inbreeding in Norway is the greatest in the world, and the same is true of the percentage of children born with Down syndrome and other birth defects.' Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gražina Leščinskiene hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service. She claimed he had been taken from her after displaying what was deemed to be 'sexualised behaviour', which included frequent visits to the toilet and sniffing his hands. Dag Malmer Halvorsen, Norwegian Ambassador to Lithuania was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations form to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime . She is still fighting to have her son returned to her. Norway's Ambassador to Lithuania Dag Halvorsen admitted the issue of children being taken into care from foreign parents living in the Nordic country was a major concern in Lithuania. The problem is so widespread that Mr Halvorsen was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations firm to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime. 'It is said that there is a history of inbreeding in Norway and that there is a high incidence of Down syndrome among Norwegian children,' he told Norway's NRK channel. 'They argue therefore that it is important for Norwegian authorities to obtain fresh, foreign children, such as Lithuanian ones, to strengthen the genetic material.' Earlier this year Czech President Miloš Zeman accused the services of acting 'like the Nazis' by not allowing a Czech mother of the two seized boys to talk to them in Czech. Russian authorities have also attacked Norway over its seizure of children from their Russian-speaking families.\n",

            "The 150 people killed in the Germanwings air disaster in the French Alps have been remembered at a memorial service in Germany today. The Cardinal who led the service at the historic Cologne cathedral urged forgiveness for all of the victims - including co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who is widely blamed for 'deliberately' crashing the jet after locking the captain out of the cockpit. An investigation into the disaster revealed that Lubitz previously suffered from severe depression and his home computer showed he had researched ways of committing suicide. German President Joachim Gauck said the tragedy had not only provoked grief and sorrow, adding: 'We're being confronted with a disturbing act of destruction. Speaking at the ceremony, he said: 'We can't find an answer to the question of why so many people had to die because of a decision that one person made.' Small wooden angels were placed on the pews to comfort the 500 bereaved relatives of the doomed flights who were among 1,500 to attend the touching service. And flags have been flown at half-mast across the country as political and religious leaders join hundreds of bereaved relatives in the west-German city this morning.

Lufthansa chairman Carsten Spohr was also among the 1,500 guests, including 500 of the victims' families. The event at Europe's largest Gothic church in the west-German city was broadcast live on screens outside the cathedral and to millions of viewers nationwide. Cologne resident Ursula Mund said she would be among those watching on the large square in the city centre. The 53-year-old said: 'Of course this is a special occasion. We have all talked a lot about what happened and are still baffled by it. We are still saddened and I feel very moved today.' Michael Senker who will follow the ceremony on television said: 'It's important to me to watch because all of Germany has been particularly affected by this tragedy. We all feel touched by this horrible catastrophe.' Remembrance: Among the attendees are 500 bereaved family members whose relatives died in the horrific crash in the French Alps . Bereaved: Touching tributes and flowers (pictures) were left outside Cologne Cathedral this morning as the entire country mourns the victims of the air disaster . Moving: Mourners left flowers and touching messages to the both the victims of the air disaster and the families they left behind . Devastated: The memorial at Cologe Cathedral today (pictured) follow a memorial event near the disaster site at the village of Le Vernet in the French Alps . Never forget: Posters of black ribbons (pictured)bearing the flight number of the doomed Germanwings jet have been displayed near the cathedral where the memorial is taking place today . Mourning: Flags have been flown at half-mast across the country, including on Germany's parliament building in Berlin (pictured) Union: The memorial service will be led by the Archbishop of Cologne, Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki, and the president of the Protestant Church of Westphalia . Forgiveness: Cologne's Cardinal Rainer Woelki - who will lead the ceremony at the cathedral (pictured) - urged compassion for all those who died in the crash including Lubitz . Mourners lay flowers and lit candles on the stairways leading to the cathedral - and outside the city's main railway station nearby. A bouquet of white tulips left at the foot of the cathedral had a card with the message 'depression is incalculable,' referring to co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who suffered from the illness. Cologne's Cardinal Rainer Woelki - who will lead the ceremony - urged compassion for all those who died in the crash including Lubitz, saying: 'There are 150 victims.' The Germanwings Airbus 320 was en route to Duesseldorf from Barcelona when it crashed in the French Alps on March 24 - killing everyone aboard. Germany was devastated by the loss of its citizens which included 16 young students and two teachers from a high school in the small town of Haltern-am-See who were returning from a class trip to Spain. Co-pilot Lubitz, who had been diagnosed as suicidal in the past, is believed to have deliberately flown the plane into the mountainside after locking the captain out of the cockpit. Disastrous: Among those who died when the plane went down in the French Alps (pictured) were 16 young students and two teachers from a high school in the small town of Haltern-am-See . Remains: Co-pilot Lubitz who is widely blamed for the crash had previously been diagnosed as suicidal . Investigators suspect Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before putting the plane into descent and increasing the jet's speed several times as it went down. Aviation industry doctors have since demanded that German pilots undergo more extensive medical checks, while several airlines worldwide have changed rules to require two crew in cockpits at all times. Lufthansa - the parent company of Germanwings - cancelled its 60th anniversary celebrations set for April. It also placed memorial pages in major newspapers dedicated to the memory of passengers and staff who died in the disaster saying: 'We will never forget them.' Loved ones of victims previously attended a memorial event near the disaster site at the village of Le Vernet in the French Alps. On April 13, foreign ministers of Germany, Spain and France also paid tribute to the victims at Barcelona airport, where the passengers embarked.\n",

But the last budget airline to operate from its terminals stopped flying in late 2011 and when the final private flights stopped a few months later, the airport shut up shop. Since then, the 28,000 sq ft terminal lies empty, where 5million passengers should have been waiting to be whisked away each year. Built in 2008, it opened fully in 2009 at a total private cost of €1.1billion, and was intended to serve both Madrid and the Andaluscian coast, each accessible by train in 50 minutes.

            "Some 35,000 gathered on the White House South Lawn Monday morning for the 137th annual Easter Egg Roll festivities. Pop band Fifth Harmony and duo MKTO brought music to the event, and Mrs Obama joined the So You Think You Can Dance All Stars on stage taking the spotlight during a choreographed routine. This comes only days after she sported her mom dance moves on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon during a segment called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2. On Monday, another highlight of the day's festivities was Mr Obama's annual reading of his favorite childhood book Where the Wild Things Are, which he has done since 2009. However, this year there was a disturbance when bees started buzzing near the children gathered for story-time on the South Lawn. Not breaking character, Mr Obama settled the shrieking children by saying: 'If you're a wild thing, you can't be scared of bees!' Moves: The First Lady busts out her best dance moves to join the So You Think You Can Dance All Stars on stage at the Easter Egg Roll . Style: The First Lady took the spotlight during the performance as she added her own flair to the choreographed routine .

This year's theme is #GimmeFive, which is part of Mrs. Obama's campaign to try to get young people to be more active and lead healthier lives. However, President Obama did confess to having a bit of not-so-healthy Easter chocolate when asked by a reporter at the event. 'I had a few, I have to admit,' Mr Obama said. Notably not in attendance were first daughters Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, Obama. The president said they were occupied by 'a little school stuff going on'. Grrrrr: President Obama reads from the children's classic Where the Wild Things Are during Monday's Easter egg roll on the White House South Lawn . 'Let the wild rumpus start!': Each year, the president reads the book which was a childhood favorite . Be brave: At one point, bees were bothering some of the children gathered to hear the president read, and he refused to break character, saying 'If you're a wild thing, you can't be scared of bees! What a crowd: An estimated 35,000 came to the White House South Lawn Monday for the annual Easter egg roll . Celebrating spring: Above, the scene on the White House's South Lawn Monday morning as the Easter egg roll kicked off . Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll in which kids compete to move their egg to the finish line first using only a wooden spoon. Staying true to the roll's theme, the president kept active during the event, playing tennis with Danish racket star Caroline Wozniacki and basketball with members of the Washington Wizards. Despite all the pick-up games he stages on the South Lawn courts, Mr Obama appears not to have improved his game much since he was hit in the head while shooting hoops Monday.

A Malayan flying fox named Kamilah, was also brought in to teach the children about bats and their ecosystems. For this year's celebrations, the White House collaborated with Snapchat and asked attendees to send out pictures on the social media app so that people around the world can follow along. It's a race! President Obama and the first lady watch as young boys and girls participate in the Easter egg roll . And they're off! Mr Obama blows a whistle to signal the start of the Easter egg roll where children compete to move an egg down a course the fastest using only a wooden spoon . The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, a sympathetic President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling when lawmakers passed a law banning the game from Capitol grounds.

            "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued. 'I wanna know how you know that. Because you're a teacher, and you're standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting 'to be bullied'. 'You're not being bullied, because you're asking me a question, I'm going to ask you questions back,' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. 'He said, \"I'm not bullying you' as he bullied her,\"' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie's town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. 'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,' Christie said Tuesday.\n",

            "New York City cab drivers spend their entire work days eavesdropping on their customers conversations, so it's no surprise that many of them have learned a thing or two about love and relationships along the way. With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own – but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what’s best for the other person. If you’re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can’t do that, you’re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden – suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner’s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won’t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don’t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you’re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don’t do that.'\n",

            "In a world where online shopping is king, Toshiba hopes technology can change the in store experience - with a robo-assistant. The firm's humanoid robot is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo to help customers find their way around. The female-looking robot, named Aiko Chihira, will only speak Japanese - but she is also capable of sign language. Scroll down for video . Toshiba's humanoid robot known as Aiko Chihira, is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo. Chihira in the work outfit created for the robot . However, Chihira is unlikely to engage in smalltalk its makers admit. Instead the robot was created to appear, talk and move as humanly as possible. Chihira blinks, bows and moves its mouth and lips smoothly while speaking. A Toshiba spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that Chihira is programmed with multiple human-like expressions, and that it will offer six-minute guidance to customers with information about the department store including events. Chihira has appeared at exhibitions and events, but this is the first time it will provide customer service. The robot’s appearance wasn’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. The robot will be set up at the Mitsukoshi department store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on Monday and Tuesday. Ms Chihira uses sign language to introduce itself to humans. Toshiba describes the eerie android, which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile, as having the appearance of 'a friendly young woman.' At present, the android can mimic only simple movements, such as exchanging greetings and signing in Japanese. The technology was first shown off at Ceatec 2014 in Japan. One of the most popular devices there was TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid. A smartphone application makeS the dinosaur walk or jump, while a shake of the smartphone prompts the TE Saurus to bark. TE Saurus can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app. Another highlight is Omron's three-legged robot, which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong. It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path, and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits. The robot’s appearance wasn’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. With five motors to control paddle movement, it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return. 'This ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner,' said Takuya Tsuyuguchi, an Omron manager. 'We envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something. 'This would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately.'

One of the most popular devices is TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid . But the company soon hopes to integrate its technologies in areas including sensing, speech synthesis, speech recognition and robotic control to create a more social robot by 2020. The goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia, to offer telecounselling in natural speech, communicate through sign language, and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people. Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘wobble but never fall down.’ To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball. And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over. The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing. Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move. They remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles. Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control (ESC) systems that prevent cars from skidding. Each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors, and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects, even in the dark. And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space. Meanwhile a group of 14-inch (36cm) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography. Murata manufacturing, an electronic component manufacturer, presented the cheerleaders with colour-changing pom-poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance. 'These robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents, in real time, the robots from clashing together,' said Tomoyuki Mori, a Murata engineer.

            "Dongguan, China (CNN)For a decade, the New South China Mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and China. Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a \"dead mall\" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. \"It's been a big change. It's a clear modernization,\" said David Carr, an English teacher from the United States who is living in Dongguan with his wife Danae, also a teacher. \"We come here at least once a month now.\" Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. But most of the unoccupied units, along with halls and walkways are under renovation. Even on a Saturday, it's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack-hammering and sawing. Ms Shu, head of New South China Mall's marketing unit, told CNN that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring, when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants. \"All construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in May,\" she said, declining to give her full name. \"We expect that from May, we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops.\" She said she couldn't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media. Ms Ye, head of investments, confirmed that \"business is really great,\" but would not comment further. Dutch retail chain Spar, which has expanded its supermarket to two floors, explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall's \"upgrading and retrofitting program.\" There are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall. When I spoke to her, Huang Haiyan, a young Chinese woman, was just two days away from opening a little café called \"Miss & H\" in one of the passage ways being renovated. Sitting on the sidewalk outside the café, she and her partners were busy washing up cups, classes and plates ahead of the big day. \"I'm so excited!\" she said, showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when I last visited the mall two years ago. \"You must come, my coffee is the best in China!\" The area around the previously run-down Arc de Triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes. In January, a globe shaped IMAX-style cinema was launched at the outdoor square. One of the more eye-catching new sources of entertainment is a role-playing amusement center for children called Myrules World. Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. It's hard to believe how rapid the change has been. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. \"Many large malls (and residential construction) in China.... are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class,\" he said. \"What is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to (the much larger) bulk of middle-class Chinese.\" And, he says, other developments that were once labeled \"ghost cities\" have gone on to thrive. \"One to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments, so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional,\"Jackson said. Despite its retrofitting program, the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly. Most of Dongguan's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. The town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in China or to Southeast Asia where wages are lower. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. In March, prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. In 2007, the mall changed name from \"South China Mall\" to \"New South China Mall, Living City\" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city .\n",

            "A University of South Carolina ex-sorority girl has been suspended after she was pictured writing that 'n*****s' were to blame for the campus's poor Internet connection on a whiteboard in a study room. The white female student, who has not been identified, was captured in a Snapchat photo detailing several 'reasons why USC WiFi blows' on the board at the university in Columbia, South Carolina. Her reasons included 'incompetent' professors, 'ratchets', an 'overpopulated campus' and parking. But at the top of the list was the word 'n*****s'. Her actions were captured by a fellow student. Scroll down for video . Suspended: This University of South Carolina student has been suspended after she was pictured writing that 'n*****s' were to blame for the campus's poor Internet connection on a whiteboard in a study room . After the shocking image was posted online, the girl, who was a member of the campus's Kappa Delta Chapter sorority until last year, was identified by other students and condemned for the slur. However, she is yet to be named by school officials. Now, university president Harris Pastides has announced that the student has been suspended  - and is also facing a USC code of conduct inquiry. In a statement, Mr Pastides said: 'The unfortunate and disappointing act of a student in a study room has challenged the Carolina community to reflect on our values and tell the world what we believe. 'Respect for all is at the heart of the Carolinian Creed, the code by which we agree to abide. Racist and uncivil rhetoric have no place at the University of South Carolina.' Campus: After the picture was posted online, the girl, who was a member of the university's (pictured) Kappa Delta Chapter sorority until last year, was identified by other students and condemned for the slur . Shocking: The image marks the third racially-charged incident on a college campus in the past week. At Duke University, a noose was found hanging from a tree. The student responsible is no longer on campus . He added that the school's Board of Trustees has endorsed the suspension, according to multiple media outlets. A school spokesman would not comment on whether the girl faces expulsion. The picture marks the third racially-charged incident on a college campus in the past week. Three students at Bucknell University were expelled  for making racist comments during a March 20 campus radio broadcast. Meanwhile, at Duke University, a noose was found hanging from a tree. A student has admitted to placing the noose on the tree, and is no longer on campus, officials said, although disciplinary actions are pending and criminal charges are under consideration. Protest: Duke students Ashton Pemberton, left, and Denzel Caldwell rally with hundreds of others during a university-wide forum on April 1 outside Duke Chapel after the noose was discovered hanging from a tree .\n",

            "Peering into the heart of the Milky Way, astronomers have spotted the 'howls' of dead stars as they feed on stellar companions. These zombie stars are thought to be leaving a 'mass grave' of white dwarf stars near the centre of the Milky Way. But why there are so many of these stars here - which are left behind when a larger star runs out of fuel - remains a mystery. Scroll down for video . The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuStar, has captured a new high-energy X-ray view (magenta) of the bustling center of our Milky Way galaxy. The smaller circle shows the center of our galaxy where the NuStar image was taken . The finding, published in Nature, was made by scientists at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, US using Nasa's NuStar telescope. 'We can see a completely new component of the centre of our galaxy with Nustar's images,' said Kerstin Perez of Columbia University in New York. 'We can't definitively explain the X-ray signal yet - it's a mystery. More work needs to be done.' When a star runs out of fuel it usually collapses in on itself. Stars more than eight times the mass of our sun will explode in a supernova, leaving behind a neutron star or black hole. Smaller stars, though, will shed their outer layers and leave behind a hot dense core – known as a white dwarf. A white dwarf contains a similar amount of mass to its previous star but will be much smaller – about the size of Earth – making gravity at its surface much more intense. They are thought to be able to burn for tens or hundreds of billions of years - at which point they  become black dwarfs – but as the universe is not this old, no black dwarfs exist in the universe yet. When they peered at the Galactic Centre, they found an emission of X-rays that corresponded to thousands of dead stars being present. The emission could also be due to millisecond pulsars - rapidly rotating neutron stars - or dense magnetic fields. 'However, all these interpretations pose significant challenges to our understanding of stellar evolution, binary formation and cosmic-ray production in the Galactic Centre,' the researchers wrote in their paper. The emissions were found to be coming from a region of the Galactic Centre 13 by 26 light-years in size around the central supermassive black hole, called Sagittarius A*. On theory is that when stars die, they don't always go quietly into the night. Unlike stars like our sun, collapsed dead stars that belong to stellar pairs, or binaries, can siphon matter from their companions. This zombie-like 'feeding' process differs depending on the nature of the normal star, but the result may be an eruption of X-rays. But it is the potential for these to be white dwarf stars that is the most intriguing theory. Scientists at Haverford College in Pennsylvania say they have spotted X-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs (one illustrated centre) at the galaxy's centre. These are stars left behind after larger ones use up their fuel. But why thousands of these stars are here remains a mystery . There are already known to be many young, massive stars orbiting our galaxy's central supermassive black hole - but why there would be thousands of white dwarf stars as well is not clear. White dwarfs are what are left when medium-mass stars - including our sun - shed their outer layers at the end of their life. Behind is left the hot, dense core which burns white. If the white dwarf gathers too much material from a companion, its mass will reach a critical point and the star will explode. The researchers say the latest finding needs further study to get to the bottom of the mystery. 'This new result just reminds us that the galactic center is a bizarre place,' said co-author Chuck Hailey of Columbia University. 'In the same way people behave differently walking on the street instead of jammed on a crowded rush hour subway, stellar objects exhibit weird behavior when crammed in close quarters near the supermassive black hole.' Shown is the region around the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's Galactic Centre - Sagittarius A* - where the X-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs were found. Other possible explanations include millisecond pulsars, which are rapidly rotating neutron stars . Nasa's NuStar telescope (illustrated) is a space-based X-ray telescope that focuses high-energy X-rays from distant astrophysical sources. Its primary goal is to conduct a survey for black holes, but it has also been used for other purposes such as this latest research .\n",

            "Former Rangers manager Walter Smith has praised Stuart McCall for making an impact at Ibrox - but he maintains Ally McCoist was given little chance of succeeding. McCall has put Rangers in the driving seat for second place in the Scottish Championship and a place in the semi-finals of the play-offs after taking over from reluctant caretaker Kenny McDowall. McCoist was put on gardening leave just before Christmas after handing in his notice following three-and-a-half difficult seasons in charge under the chaotic reigns of the likes of Craig Whyte and then Charles Green and his allies. But his failure to win a cup competition and his team's style of play drew serious criticism. Walter Smith (right) spent two spells in charge as manager of Rangers and has hailed Stuart McCall's impact . Smith (right) attended a John Hartson Foundation golf day to raise money for testicular cancer awareness . Smith was chairman for some of that period after accepting Green's offer to join the board - a decision he soon regretted - and insists the club was too badly run to ensure true success on the park. Smith, who was attending a John Hartson Foundation golf day to help raise money for testicular cancer awareness, said: 'The guys worked with me for four-and-a-half years there and did a great job for the club, and I was hoping they would get a good opportunity. 'I got great support from Sir David Murray but it's not turned out that they have had the same support from the people who have been running the club. So it has been very difficult for them to show what they can do. 'That's the crux of the matter, it's the circumstances they have been in that have caused them as much trouble as anything else. 'I'd be very surprised if anybody could show me a club that isn't well run, that are doing really well. 'The problems have been well documented and now they have got to concentrate on doing what they do, and that's Rangers getting back to the Premiership first and foremost and then trying to settle into a position where they can get back to being a winning team.' McCall played under Smith for seven seasons, winning six titles in the process, and the 67-year-old was pleased to see the former Motherwell boss take over, despite his pain at the exits of former assistants McCoist and McDowall. McCall was appointed Rangers manager in March until the summer as a replacement for Kenny McDowall . 'I'm not happy to see it because it cost friends of mine their job,' he said. 'But that happens in football and when other people take over I am obviously pleased to see Stuart take over and I hope he does really well. 'He has been brave enough to take the job until the end of the season. If he gets promotion, he will put himself in a very good position to get the job on a more permanent basis. 'He has gone in there and got a reaction. That happens in football. It has happened to me and a whole load of other managers, when you leave and someone else comes in, they get a reaction. Rangers have won five out of nine Scottish Championship matches since McCall's arrival at Ibrox . 'Performances have been brighter and hopefully he will keep that going until the end of the season.' However, Smith has warned that Rangers fans might have to be patient in their desire to see the club competing at the very top of Scottish football, despite power now lying in the hands of the likes of Paul Murray and Dave King following last month's general meeting. 'I'm obviously happy to see everything at the club settling down,' the former Scotland boss said. 'The lack of headlines would indicate that's the case. 'The people that are running the club are just getting their feet under the table and finding out what they have to do to move the club forward. I think that's to be expected at this stage. Smith did, however, open up about Ally McCoist's departure and admitted it wasn't easy to see . 'It will obviously take a bit of time but they will be able to handle that aspect of it. Everyone who is there now is there for the football club and that's a big, big thing. 'To be fair, when I was involved on the Rangers board, it would have been different from any other boardroom never mind anything else. 'I have been fortunate enough to be at Rangers for a long time and be there at successful times and it's not a period I can look back on with any great pleasure.'\n",

And Dame Judi Dench and Jamie Lee Curtis both let their natural tones shine through. Sibi Bolan, creative colour director at top hairdressers Hershesons advises thinking carefully before you try the trend at home. ‘Find out what your options are and remember using your skin tone to find the right colour is key. Going grey on the Jean Paul Gaultier catwalk in Paris on March 1 . Angela Le posted this image on Bored Panda which shows dark hair dyed a stunning shade of silver . 'For the grey hair trend, option one is to slowly reduce the amount of colour and gracefully allow the grey to appear (if you are going grey naturally) and option two is to add lighter ash highlights to enhance and complement the grey tones. 'A great haircut is key to going grey so you don't end up looking like you have given up on yourself!' Sibi also advises using a silver shampoo. 'It helps brighten the hair and remove yellow unflattering tones that grey hair has a tendency to do. 'Often grey hair is more dry therefore absorbs things like pollution cigarette smoke dulling down the silver fox making it look like tarnished brass.'

            "Looking after elderly parents can be difficult at the best of times. But this man takes caring for his Alzheimer's-suffering mother to another level. A security guard from China has touched hearts across the country because he takes his 84-year-old mother with him to work on the back of his motorbike every single day, reported the People's Daily Online. Lu Xincai, who lives in Zhejiang province in eastern China, says that he is scared his mother will get lost if he leaves her at home by herself because she suffers from the degenerative disease. Devoted: Lu Xincai takes his 84-year-old mother to work with him on the back of his motorbike every day. He ties a sash around both of their waists to make sure she doesn't fall off . She would often go up to the mountains to collect firewood and there were a few occasions when she got lost after dark. When Mr Lu's father passed away earlier this year, he decided to take his mother with him to work because there was no one else who could look after her. His wife works in a different city and his son is still in school. After helping his mother to get up at 5am every morning, he puts her on the back seat of his motorbike and ties a sash around both of their waists to ensure that she does not fall off. Mr Lu said that he rides the four kilometres to work slowly to make sure his mother feels safe and so that they can chat along the way. The whole journey takes an hour. Even when at work he checks up on his mother, who has been given her own room by his employers, a bank, to make sure that she has not wandered off somewhere. He said that his mother devoted her life to caring for her children, and now he feels like he has a duty to care for her in return. Vulnerable: His elderly mother suffers from Alzheimer's and used to get lost when she was left alone . He said: 'I was an apple in my mum's eye, and now she's my apple.' 'Our mother carried us on her back to the fields when she went to work on the farm and collect firewood when we were young.' He added: 'Only if I see her will I feel relaxed. Otherwise I would be afraid is she had wandered away.'\n",

            "(CNN)A bus collided with a fuel tanker in southern Morocco on Friday, a fiery crash that killed at least 35 people -- most of them children -- state and local media reported. The accident caused a fire that hollowed out the bus, leaving little more than its frame. Debris scattered across the road, while smoke rose into the sky, videos posted to social media show. The dead included athletes traveling for a sporting competition, an eyewitness told 2M TV, a Moroccan state-owned network. After the crash, photos appeared on social media of young, smiling boys in soccer uniforms along with condolence messages such as \"May God have mercy on them\" and \"Oh no, they are so young.\" The crash happened near the city of Tan-Tan just before 7 a.m., the Maghreb Arabe Presse state news agency reported. It said a number of people were also injured. Tan-Tan is near the country's Atlantic coast, more than 450 kilometers (about 280 miles) southwest of Marrakesh.\n",

            "A lawsuit filed by former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford attempting to have a judge order her kids to return to the U.S. from their father's custody in France has been dismissed once and for all. The case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids, son Hermes, 8, and daughter Helena, 5, to come back to the United States. Rutherford, 46, claims her children were illegally deported to France when a California Court awarded custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch, 40, and she pleaded for the order to be reversed. Scroll down for video . Kelly Rutherford, pictured with her children, Hermes and Helena, during a party in the Hamptons in August 2013, was shut down by the courts again in a final plea to gain custody of her children . Rutherford's lawsuit stating that her children were illegally deported from the United States was dismissed once and for all by a New York court . She claimed that no other U.S. court has ordered children to live in another country when they have an able parent in the United States. Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud. But the dismissal of her case states that Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute with Giersch. 'Petitioners allege that the California state court's custody order had the effect of deporting the children in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to remain in the United States,' the document reads. The document added: 'There is no authority establishing the unconditional right of minor children to reside in the United States when one of their custodial parents lives abroad. 'Likewise there is no \"plainly defined and peremptory duty\" requiring Respondents to interfere with the custody order - nor is there, as Petitioners contend, a general affirmative duty on federal agencies requiring them to intervene against what is claimed to be unconstitutional state action.' After divorcing in 2010, Rutherford and ex-husband Daniel Giersch went through a nasty custody battle which ended with Giersch being awarded custody while the children were to visit Rutherford on vacations . Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . Further, the court states 'the children have not been deported; they retain their United States citizenship and, once they reach the age of majority, they will be free to choose where to reside. 'There is, therefore, no non-frivolous constitutional question, only an attempt to seek federal judicial intervention in a state court custody dispute' The order affirmed the original order and said it would be improper for the federal court to intervene in Rutherford's custody battle. Because of this, there will be no intervention and the appeal will be dismissed. A California court ruled two years ago that the children should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch, who she divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage. Rutherford has said that the court in Monaco, where Giersch lives, decided on a new custody order that lets her only see her children on holiday and during the summer. It has left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children. In it's dismissal of her case, the court said it failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in the custody dispute . Daily Mail Online revealed in August that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of herself and her children. She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues. She wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her ‘temporary emergency authority’ over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was ‘unconstitutional’. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said on November 24 that Rutherford's case was nothing more than her being dissatisfied with the result of the child-custody proceeding. The departments demanded on that her appeal be dismissed and said she's forcing the departments to become part of something they were never involved in. Rutherford argued her case in a New York court on March 18, but the appeal court shut down her plea and ordered the original order to remain in place.\n",

            "English cricket's new broom swept dramatically through the national team on Wednesday night when Paul Downton paid the price for their woeful World Cup by being sacked as managing director. The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of a figure who has endured a traumatic time since replacing Hugh Morris in the aftermath of the Ashes whitewash. With more sackings inevitable, Sportsmail asks: Who's next? Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician. Verdict: Vulnerable. Alastair Cook was sacked as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign . Peter Moores . An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable. Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media. Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door . The chairman of selectors James Whitaker (left) looks sure to follow Paul Downton through the exit door .\n",

            "J.B. Silverthorn got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first on Monday . A 44-year-old man got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first, after allegedly turning up to court drunk and driving away. Police say they repeatedly told J.B. Silverthorn of Orchard Park, New York, to not drive home from Grand Island Town Court on Monday night after they noticed he 'smelled of alcohol' and was 'intoxicated'. But the suspect reportedly proceeded to get in his car and pull out of the parking lot before being stopped by deputies. Silverthorn was charged with felony DUI, meaning he could serve a minimum of one year in jail. He was also booked for driving without headlights. He's currently being held in the Erie County jail with his bail set at $1,000. It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer. Silverthorn was deemed guilty this week for driving over the limit and crashing his car into the Niagara River on December 29. He was stranded three-feet deep in moving water and rescued by firefighters. He's due back in court Monday for a felony hearing. However, if he posts bail, the date could be pushed back to April 22.

            "(CNN)What do Walmart, Target, and now the Koch Brothers have in common with the American Civil Liberties Union, ColorOfChange.org, and the Center for American Progress? All of them are adopting or advocating for hiring practices that open up work opportunities for people with convictions and leverage untapped potential in the labor market. Koch Industries' recent announcement that it will \"ban the box\" -- i.e., remove from its job applications the check-box that asks about convictions -- is a big step forward in the movement to break down barriers to employment for job-seekers with records. \"Ban the box\" doesn't prohibit background checks, it only postpones them until later in the hiring process. It's one item on a menu of fair-chance hiring reforms intended to ensure that job applicants are evaluated on their skills and qualifications first, rather than judged solely on past mistakes. These policies help reduce recidivism by making employment accessible to job-seekers who need a second chance, and they help break down the stigma of an arrest or conviction record. Two generations of the war on drugs, zero tolerance, and aggressive policing have left 70 million adults  with arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs, even as the job market has grown steadily. Millions of people are being left behind, and it's taking a toll on our economy: The reduced economic output of people with records cost our economy $57-$65 billion in 2008 alone. These criminal justice policies disproportionately impact African-Americans, who are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites. The Department of Justice's recent investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, for example, shows the extent to which racism is perpetuated through police departments and the court system. That systemic racial disparity is then repeated throughout the economy, and the community is put at a severe disadvantage in the job market long after individuals have served their time. That's one reason the African-American unemployment rate is persistently twice that of whites. In a job market where employers that didn't previously do background checks now make them a routine part of hiring, qualified job-seekers are being screened out of the applicant pools for more and more jobs. Nearly one in three adults in America has an arrest or conviction history that will show up on a routine background check. Companies like Koch, Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond recognize that this is a huge source of untapped talent, and that's why they've already banned the box on their job applications. These policies are also gaining traction with politicians across the political spectrum. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment. So far, 16 states and more than 100 cities and counties have adopted fair-chance hiring policies. Six of those states and the District of Columbia, plus 25 cities and counties, have applied their policies to government contractors or private employers as well. The Obama administration took an important step toward fairer and smarter federal hiring practices last year when it issued an executive order prohibiting contractors from discriminating against LGBT individuals. Banning the box and other common-sense hiring reforms would build on that progress and on the successful work of governors and the corporate sector. The administration should ensure that the federal government does not continue to erect unfair and unnecessary barriers to employment of people with records. Already, more than 200 organizations and prominent individuals have publicly urged the Obama administration to take these practical steps. If Koch Industries -- a major federal contractor -- can ban the box, there's no reason why other federal contractors cannot. Now it's time for President Obama to lead the way and embrace fair-chance hiring of people with records.\n",

            "Derby County season ticket holders from the 2010-11 campaign might struggle to believe it but Alberto Bueno prepares to face his former club Real Madrid on Wednesday as the highest-scoring Spanish-national in La Liga with a big money move to Porto waiting for him at the end of the season. Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him. Alberto Bueno (left) in action for Derby against Norwich during his unsuccessful spell with the club . Bueno celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Real Union in November 2008 . Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season and could soon move to Porto . AGE: 27 . CLUBS (League record only) Real Madrid (2006-09): 97 apps, 22 goals . Real Madrid (2008-09): 3 apps, 0 goals . Valladolid (2009-13): 85 apps, 13 goals . Derby (loan, 2010-11): 29 apps, 5 goals . Rayo Vallecano (2013-) 65 apps, 26 goals . Seventeen of the 35 goals that Rayo have scored this season have come from Bueno. He hit four in one game earlier this year against Levante and will be gunning for his old club on Wednesday night. Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madrid’s youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain. Negredo and Soldado both made it into the Spain squad after they succeeded away from Madrid and national team boss Vicente Del Bosque will be watching on Wednesday when Bueno goes up against Sergio Ramos as Rayo Vallecano look to take the scalp of Real Madrid in their rickety atmosphere-charged three-sided Vallecas stadium.\n",

            "The cost of a daily lunchtime takeaway can be crippling and yet instead of making lunches at home the majority of British workers still pop to the high street to grab their midday meal. The 'meal deal' (which is not always a meal, or a deal) has seen us stave off the hunger pangs with soggy sandwiches, slimy salads and salty soups, spending an average of £1,840 a year. But we could save up to £1,300 a year if we just prepared our lunch at home. Cheese, crackers and charcuterie is a simple and delicious lunch which can be easily assembled in the office . Food website Food52's 'Not Sad Desk Lunch' series demonstrates just how simple it can be to bring healthy, cost-effective, and delicious lunches to work. These incredibly detailed ideas and recipes show how to make everything from easy-to-assemble options such cheese and crackers, to more complicated steamed Chinese buns, and Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches . Each recipe on Food52 is contributed by a member of the team who promises to keep your midday meals 'both interesting and pretty.' If you're after something simple, cheese, crackers and charcuterie will do the job. Simply choose your favourites, assemble and eat; and If you're vegetarian, swap meat for pickled vegetables and you're good to go. Make something complicated like stuffed dumplings (left) or keep it simple with a toast tartine (right) Hannah Petertil has some inspired combinations which include Cheddar, apple, and bacon jam; mozzarella and prosciuotto or manchego and dried apricots. Keeping with the theme, you could also use the handy cracker to spread a variety of toppings. Make a Greek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta; a hummus cracker with roasted red pepper on top; pesto crackers with thinly sliced prosciutto; or smashed avocado crackers. Don't feel like spreading? Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go. Workers could save up to £1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed. More than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of £1,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals. In comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just £552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping £1,288. The startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home. Pita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables. Experiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes. Remember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita. Still sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine. Spread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous. The site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment. Steamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which  can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou). Jenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.' Steamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms . You can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them. Freeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave. Looking for something even more exotic? Author of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters. Banh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats. The bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in. To make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office. Buns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead. 'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.

            "Jay Z launched a stream of tweets defending his premium music streaming app Tidal after the service, launched last month, was described as a flop. His social media diatribe comes as reports claim that Tidal is being sabotaged by rivals as it attempts to take business away from more-established music outlets such as Spotify and Apple. 'We may not be perfect - but we are determined,' he said while claiming that there are 'many big companies that are spending millions on a smear campaign'. 'We are here for the long haul,' the rapper and businessman tweeted in a string of 'stream of consciousness' messages. Scroll down for video . Twitter rant: Jay Z unleashed a string of 'stream of consciousness' tweets on Sunday defending his premium music streaming service Tidal and saying that it is still early days for the app . Tidal tweets: Using the hashtag #TidalFacts, the rap mogul told naysayers that 'actions will speak louder than words' as he continues to fine tune the streaming service he purchased for $56 million in January . Equality for all: The rapper and businessman insisted that Tidal is good for all artists and not just a money-maker for the big name artists like Kanye, Rihanna and Madonna who have joined him as co-founders . Feeling the need to vent: Jay Z decided to take to social media on Sunday in an aggressive push after what he saw as a 'smear campaign' from big companies against Tidal . Jay Z, who paid $56 million for TIDAL's technology in January and relaunched it in March, went on the offensive against the supposed smear campaign. Tidal has potential rivals including popular streaming service Spotify and tech giant Apple, though Jay Z did not post any details about the alleged campaign. After Tidal was criticized because of the wealth of its founders, the rapper said that other big tech companies also have huge amounts of money. 'Rich getting richer? Equity values... YouTube $390 billion. Apple $760 billion. Spotify $8 billion. Tidal $60 million,' he said. On Sunday Page Six claimed that there's also a 'war' looming between Tidal and Apple. Citing industry sources, the New York Post's gossip site alleged that tech giant Apple is trying to impede Tidal ahead of the scheduled relaunch in June of its own Beats Music by taking a long time to approve iOS updates for the Tidal app. 'Tidal had a new app on Android on April 15, but still hasn’t received approval for Apple’s iOS app store,' a source said. The site claimed that after Rihanna's song American Oxygen debuted on Tidal, there were technical problems with her music on iTunes. Apple told Page Six that the allegations that Rihanna's songs were deliberately scrambled are not true. The spokesperson declined to comment on the other claims made in the article, according to Page Six. War looming: A report from Page Six on Sunday said that Apple, which is launching its own music service, is trying to stop any growth by Tidal by delaying availability of updates for its app . Big guns: Tidal charges users $19.99 a month for its premium music streaming service and aims to take on rivals such as Spotify, Pandora and Apple's iTunes. Madonna and Rihanna are among the company's backers . In the same article, Page Six also alleged that Robert Kondrk, vice president of iTunes Content, has said any artists who put out exclusive music on Tidal won't be featured artists on iTunes. The article also reported that Sony Music will not grant Tidal a license to stream from Sony artists, one of whom is, of course, Jay Z's wife Beyonce. A representative for Sony Music declined to comment to Page Six. A month ago, some of the biggest names in music joined Jay Z for the launch of Tidal but the $19.99 a month subscription service is floundering in the app downloads charts. According to Billboard.com on Sunday, Tidal, which launched on March 30, has fallen out of Apple's top 750 apps, after a peak at No. 83 on April 7. The rapper's Twitter rant and news of tensions with other tech companies come after a week of bad press for TIDAL. The company's CEO Andy Chen also recently left the company amid a 'streamlining' of staff. Even those close to Jay-Z were seen as moving away from the potential failure. Co-founder Kanye West changed his Twitter avatar away from a logo for the service and deleted all mention of it from his account earlier this week. He later reaffirmed his support for the service in a tweet saying 'The love of music is louder than words'. Despite reports of its stuttering start, Jay-Z insisted on Twitter that Tidal is doing just fine. 'We have over 770,000 subs. We have been in business less than one month,' he tweeted, and included the hashtag #TidalFacts. Tweet of support: Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage at the New York relaunch of Tidal on March 31, used his Twitter account Sunday to support the company . Tidal is co-owned by Jay Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, Madonna, Rihanna, Jack White, Alicia Keys and others. In his Sunday stream of tweets, Jay Z stressed that the service pays a 75 percent royalty rate to all artists and not just the high profile founders who appeared on stage at the launch. Other info he shared under the hashtag #TidalFacts included that 'iTunes Store wasn't built in a day' and 'It took Spotify 9 years to be successful.' TIDAL has attempted to differentiate away from its competitors by billing itself as having higher quality audio and being focused on rewarding those making music. Jay-Z referenced Tidal X which 'supports artists by giving them a platform to connect with their most loyal fans. Tidal is for all.' Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage for the Tidal  launch in New York, jumped on the bandwagon Sunday. He tweeting his followers:  'despite whatever dumbs**t preconceptions you may or may not have about tidal, im still behind it. Im in it for industry growth, not PR. (sic).' Several artists have publicly criticized the roll-out, saying that Jay Z made it seem as if some of the world's biggest musicians wanted more money. 'When they say it's artist-owned, it's owned by those rich, wealthy artists,' Marcus Mumford, the frontman of Mumford & Sons, said in a recent and widely-disseminated interview with The Daily Beast website. Friction: Page Six claimed Sunday that Sony Music won't give Tidal a license to stream music by artists signed to it labels, which include Jay Z's wife Beyonce . Not all artists are fans: Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons has criticized Tidal saying it's just a way for wealthy artists to get richer .\n",

            "(CNN)Much like the ardent young royal-watchers of today, enamored by the Duchess of Cambridge's very being, I was similarly captivated by Diana, Princess of Wales when I was a youngster. She was a rare breed: stunningly beautiful, immediately accessible, witty, charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million. Of course that was long before the, \"there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,\" interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal, but back then I was unaware of her more scandalous infamy. I simply adored her ... I still do. As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate. Girls' names are causing the biggest stir, as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess. If the assumptions are correct, she will be the first Princess of Cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years. The birth of any baby is cause for celebration, but given recent changes in the laws of succession, her arrival would be a historical one. In choosing a name, titled royals tend to turn to the family tree, rather than a well-thumbed copy of \"1,001 Best Baby Names\" like the rest of us. Traditionally they pick dynastic names, and there are plenty to choose from: Elizabeth, Alice, Victoria and Charlotte have all been frontrunners, but the sentimental favorite among punters remains Diana. In a recent Today Show poll, 32% of Americans predicted the name was a shoo-in, and in the UK the bookies' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as Diana becomes an increasingly popular choice. That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana. Today Diana's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself: while some have virtually sainted her, others have been vehemently critical, accusing her of being childish, unhinged and self-serving. Contrary to popular belief the Queen was very fond of Diana, but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby, it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy. In the years since Earl Spencer's scathing attack on the Windsors at Diana's funeral, the nation has moved on and Diana's legacy has been celebrated. She has become a part of royal history. Her memory has been preserved, and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity. Out of respect to the Queen, Charles, Camilla and the baby herself the couple simply wouldn't do it. Diana's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over, and whichever side of the fence you're on, the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry. Since Diana's death almost 18 years ago, William has honored his mother's memory in a private and personal fashion. He has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes. At his wedding in 2011 the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, a close friend of Diana and executor of her will, gave the address. The hymn Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was sung at both Diana's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007, was chosen for the royal wedding. Julia Samuel, another close friend of Diana, was asked to serve as Godmother to Prince George. William chose Kensington Palace, his own childhood home, to be the primary residence for his family, and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother's memory, he gave Kate Diana's engagement ring. William doesn't need to name his second-born child after his mother in order to honour her; he does so by being a good husband and father. I still miss Diana. She was a one-off, and I don't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her. Daily comparisons to her late mother-in-law are already Kate's cross to bear. Shouldn't a baby girl be spared the same fate? Diana's tragic, untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come. She wouldn't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow. She would want her to go out into the world, to make her own mark and help those less fortunate, to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as Alice, Elizabeth, Victoria, Charlotte, or -- my own personal pick -- Alexandra.\n",

            "A handwritten book containing notes and calculations made by Alan Turing while he worked on decoding Enigma  has been sold at auction for £700,000. The 56-page document, believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript in existence, was written in 1942 at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. The notebook, in which he details his work on the foundations of mathematical notation and computer science, was sold for $1,025,000 (£698,000) in a Fine Books & Manuscripts Sale at Bonhams in New York on Monday. Scroll down for video . Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (£690,000). Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' Turing is best known for his contribution to cracking the code used by the Germans in their Enigma machines during the Second World War while working at at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. He is often said to be the father of modern computing and artificial intelligence. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said: 'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The 56-page book bought in Cambridge contains Turing's thoughts on the clearly tricky 'Leibniz notation dx/dy'. 'I find [it] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once!' he wrote. Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' Prior to the sale, Andrew Hodges, a leading Turing scholar, said: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value. 'This notebook shines extra light on how, even when he was enmeshed in great world events, he remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' But Turing died from cyanide poisoning in 1954, generally thought to have been an act of suicide as a consequence of the hormone treatment he was undergoing as an alternative to imprisonment for his homosexuality. Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the British Government in 2009 for the way Turing had been treated and he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous. Part of the proceeds will be donated to charity. Cassandra Hatton, senior specialist in Fine Books and Manuscripts and the History of Science at Bonhams, said: \"This is a wonderful result and a fitting testament to Alan Turing's impact and legacy. 'It has been a great privilege to have been involved in this sale and we are immensely pleased that all the people who bid for this unique item and indeed the wider public have recognised Turing's importance and place in history.' Bonhams said a rare three-rotor German Enigma Enciphering Machine sold at the same auction for a world record price of 269,000 dollars (£183,000). A portion of the proceeds from Bonhams and the vendor will be donated to charity, the auctioneers said.\n",

            "Tory Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith came under fire today after suggesting that zero-hours contracts should be re-named 'flexible hours'. Labour said the 'Marie Antoinette' moment by the Work and Pensions Secretary showed 'just how out of touch the Tories are' about the lives of working people. The future of zero-hours deals has become of the key issues of the election battle over jobs, with Labour pledging to ban exploitative deals. Tory Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith came under fire today after suggesting that zero-hours contracts should be re-named 'flexible hours' In a TV interview today Mr Duncan Smith said that zero-hours contracts were 'wrongly named'. He told the BBC: 'It should be flexible hours contracts, but only 2 per cent of the total workforce have those and they are mostly people like carers, who can't give direct time, and young people like students, so for them there is a reason for those.' Aides to the minister stressed that job satisfaction and work-life balance for those on zero-hours contracts were similar to other workers. Some 60 per cent of people on zero-hours contracts do not want more hours, they said. Labour and trade union leaders criticised the comments, saying it showed the minister was 'out of touch'. Shadow business Secretary Chuka Umunna told MailOnline: 'Iain Duncan Smith's 'Marie Antoinette' moment today has revealed just how out of touch the Tories are about the lives of working people. 'Instead of acknowledging the worrying growth of zero-hours contracts in our economy, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions today chose to defend them – arguing this morning that we should simply rename them as flexible hours contracts. 'Instead of pledging to tackle exploitation in the labour market he refused to even acknowledge there was a problem.' Labour leader Ed Miliband today launched his party's manifesto for young people in Lincoln . Labour has pledged to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, while unions have been pressing for them to be scrapped altogether. Under the controversial contracts, workers are often told at the end of the week how many hours they can work the following week. Launching Labour's manifesto for young people in Lincoln, party leader Ed Miliband said: 'Young people are three times more likely to be on zero-hours contracts than the rest of the population. 'Iain Duncan Smith has tried today to rename zero-hours contracts as 'flexible contracts'. We don't need to rename zero-hours contracts, we need to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and that's what the next Labour government will do.' Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, said zero-hours contracts meant 'misery' or workers and their families, leaving them on a 'hand to mouth' existence. 'This insecurity has exploded on David Cameron's watch, where we have an economy built on shaky jobs and chronic low pay.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Whatever you call a zero-hours contract, it is still a recipe for insecurity and exploitation, where the boss holds all the power. 'Nothing sums up what is wrong with this Government's approach to work and how out of touch they are with the way most people live their lives than this celebration of the zero-hours contract. 'If you put lipstick on a pig, it is still a pig. But as 'zero-hours contracts' is a bit of a mouthful, perhaps we could call them 'IDS jobs' in the future.' Shadow business Secretary Chuka Umunna accused the Tories of being out of touch . Iain Duncan Smith's 'Marie Antoinette' moment today has revealed just how out of touch the Tories are about the lives of working people. Instead of acknowledging the worrying growth of zero-hours contracts in our economy, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions today chose to defend them – arguing this morning that we should simply rename them as flexible hours contracts. Instead of pledging to tackle exploitation in the labour market he refused to even acknowledge there was a problem. The Tories have a history of Let Them Eat Cake moments. Today's comment comes from the minister who renamed the Bedroom Tax the 'removal of the spare room subsidy' and the party which insisted on calling the poll tax the 'community charge'. And three weeks ago David Cameron said that more people are using food banks because of better advertising – next he'll be rebadging them as Big Society supermarkets. This reveals an important truth about the Tories – they simply won't stand up for working people. Just a few weeks ago David Cameron admitted he couldn't live on a zero-hours contract. But the Tories seem happy for working people to be stuck in low-paid zero-hour contract jobs. It's becoming increasingly clear throughout this campaign that they will only stand up for a privileged few. The reality – that the Tories refused to acknowledge – is that for too many people zero-hours contracts leave them without a regular income and not knowing from one day to the next how much work they will get. The number of people with zero-hour contracts has increased by almost 20 per cent in the last year and surveys show that over half of young people on these contracts are on them because they could not find a job with regular hours. Companies such as Sports Direct are hiring the vast majority of their workers on zero-hours contracts, even though they have predictable and manageable fluctuations in demand and many of these employees reportedly work regular hours in practice. This is insecurity dressed up as flexibility. It's not acceptable, it's not fair and Labour will act to stop it. Labour will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts. With Labour, if you work regular hours for 12 weeks or more you will get a right to a regular contract. We will also give workers on zero-hours contracts new rights to be protected from employers forcing them to be available at all hours or cancelling shifts at short notice without compensation. Labour is clear: we don't need to rename exploitative zero-hours contracts. We need to ban them.​ .\n",

            "Shops are full of red dresses this year, so should you be tempted to trade in your LBD for an LRD? It’s a colour that radiates energy and sexiness, but that can all be wrecked if the style doesn’t suit you. We asked Kate Battersby to try six looks to see which work — and which absolutely don’t. Scroll down for video . I LOOK SO OLD IN THIS! Dress, £270, Gina Bacconi at johnlewis.com . Shoes, £485, biondacastana.com . Lace may be back in fashion, but to me it’s unfailingly ageing. The unattractive shade of orangey-red is made worse by the colour of the underslip — a queasy pale peach. Its weight suggests that it’s reinforced concrete and while thick fabric can smooth problem areas, here it bulges at the waist. The shallow V-neck doesn’t enhance my bust, the sash creates matronliness and the asymmetric lace around the neckline looks torn. 0/5 . IT COULD BE DESIGNER . Dress, £150, Adrianna Papell at johnlewis.com . Sandals, £255, lucychoilondon.com . The lipstick red shade complements pale and deeper skin tones. The ruched style is reminiscent of Herve Leger’s famous bandage dresses, insofar as the fabric stretches to flatter just where it’s needed. My 36DD bust means that a bateau neckline usually creates a gigantic shelf of bosom, but the sheer panel on this stylish dress is an ingenious solution. 4/5 . FIGURE-HUGGING FAILSAFE . Dress, £89, divacatwalk.com . Sandals, £395, carlopazolini.com . Several celebs turn to this British brand’s curve-hugging designs, with Nigella Lawson a devotee. This dress looks great on the hanger and I can’t wait to try it on. The fit is divine and the dress feels marvellous. The hourglass silhouette has me embracing my inner Joan Holloway from Mad Men. 4/5 . TOTAL KNOCKOUT . Dress, £265, thefoldlondon.com . Shoes, £575, biondacastana.com . It is difficult to overstate how utterly horrible this looks on the hanger — a drearily shapeless, nondescript sack. Imagine my amazement at the transformation once it’s on. The fit is great, with a length that does wonders for your legs, and the cowl neck provides just enough detail to prevent my bust from creating a vista of bare chest. 4/5 . ONE-SHOULDER SUPERSTAR . Dress, £189, gorgeouscouture.com . A floor-length gown is not top of my must-haves. But it’s always good to have a dress in the wardrobe that makes you feel a knockout. One-shoulder designs create glamour, and in this case the broader band of fabric at the shoulder flatters the exposed arm. Draping and ruching will flatter any figure, and the dress is helped by a body- hugging underslip. ‘Very Michelle Obama,’ said an onlooker. 5/5 . CRIMSON NIGHTMARE . Dress, £48, asos.com . Heels, £195, lkbennett.com . First the good news: this crimson colour scores highly for drama, no matter what your skin tone or hair colour. Next, the fit, which is fabulous over my hips and waist, but less so in the bodice. In my case another reason to fear the ultra-plunge neckline is that sensitive skins can become blotchy in the decolletage area when we are too hot. In any case, there is so much going on it’s easy to be drowned in all the detail. 2/5 .\n",

The Neville brothers both took to Twitter to express their delight at gaining promotion, with a few beers likely to be consumed over the week. Scholes and Gary were in attendance for Salford's victory against Clitheroe Town before they made made it eight wins on the bounce the following week away to Burscough. Salford knew that a 1883 win would take the title race to the final game of the season but they were unable to get the better of Warrington Town - handing the trophy to their rivals. Darlington's manager Martin Gray showed a real touch of class by personally calling Gary and joint-manager Anthony Johnson to congratulate them of their achievement. Following this, Phil showed the same sort of courtesy and wished Gray's side well in the play-off's. Salford clinched the title on a fitting 92 pointsand with one game to spare after their eight-game winning streak . The Class of '92 bought into the club last year and their investments have worked wonders, with the club earning instant success in their first full season at the helm. But recently the co-owners admitted that it wasn't all plain sailing after former manager Phil Power was sacked in January, with Phil conceding that were turning into something they had always said they wouldn't. The former Everton man said: ‘We had become the meddling owners, everything we didn’t want to be.' With the Football League just three more promotions away, Salford's fans and very famous owners can dream about that prospect. Some of the Class of '92 take in a pre-season friendly against Stalybridge Celtic in the summer .

            "A mother of four has pledged to remove her children from school to attend an ancient Maypole festival - despite facing fines or even prosecution. Anna James, 32, has vowed to defy the school's ban on taking her children to the 'Obby 'Oss celebrations - claiming the rituals are part of her 'religion, culture and heritage.' The school blocked her request under a government crackdown on unauthorised absences  announced in 2013. Mrs James pictured with her son Ethan (far left), Piran (centre) and Sophia (right) at last year's Maypole festival . But Mrs James said she would be willing to take the consequences of any police action to take her children Ethan, 11, Piran, 5, Sophia, 8, and four month old baby Faith to the event. The annual May 1 celebration is a centuries' old tradition, involving music and dancing through the streets, believed by some to be an ancient pagan fertility ritual which heralds the arrival of spring. Held every year in Padstow, Cornwall at midnight on May 1, it consists of parades and celebrations throughout the town and into the following day. Mrs James, who moved from Padstow to St Austell, Cornwall, eight years ago, said: 'I think it's ridiculous that I'm being told I can't take my children to the event. 'Obby 'Oss is something which my family has celebrated for generations. 'It's part of our heritage, our culture and our religion. If I wanted to take children out of school for some other religion I think it would be a different story. 'I don't expect the St Austell schools to close, but I do think that any school in Cornwall should be sensitive to the needs of people from Padstow to return to their home town on May 1. The event itself is educational.' Mrs James, 32, has vowed to defy the school's ban on taking her children to the 'Obby 'Oss celebrations. Pictured from left to right is Sophia, 8, Ethan, 11, Faith, 4 months, and Piran, 5 . In 2013, former Education Secretary Michael Gove ended the right for schools to grant up to 10 days holiday per year for pupils. New guidelines state that children should only be taken out of school during term-time if it is an 'exceptional circumstance'. Government rules state that it is at the discretion of each individual school to authorise or reject absence requests. Under the current system, parents who take their children out of school without permission could face a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. Padstow Primary School children are included in the 'Obby 'Oss tradition. But leaders at Bishop Bronescombe School in St Austell would not authorise Mrs James' request for her children to join them. Mrs James said: 'For Padstow residents the day is a massively important part of their cultural heritage. 'I'm not an expert on its origins but I do believe it can be described as having religious significance. 'Just because I don't live in Padstow any more doesn't mean I can't celebrate my religion. I would do the same even if I lived in Australia.' The crackdown by the Government on absences was outlined in 2013 and stipulates children should attend lessons rather than take time off to suit parental convenience. The crackdown was announced by the then Education Secretary Michael Gove who intended to stop parents taking children out of school to benefit from cheaper holidays. Mrs James said the festival was part of her family's religion, culture and heritage . But the government insists that local head teachers still have the discretion to approve up to ten absences a year 'in exceptional circumstances'. Bishop Bronescombe School declined to comment. In Padstow, where children are an integral part of the festival, the school closes so pupils can take part in the early-morning dances. Padstow School head teacher Phil Banks said: 'We take May 1 as a community closure day as the majority of our children and staff will be taking part in the festivities. 'It is such an important part of their cultural heritage that we feel it is extremely important for us to support and celebrate it. 'I can understand the position of the St Austell schools, however. 'Guidelines on allowing absence nowadays are incredibly tight. I would imagine a number of schools in the area get requests like this, and not necessarily from people who can claim any legitimate link to Padstow.' Mrs James, who is currently on maternity leave from her job as a PA, said that she has attended the event every year since she was born and for residents of Padstow it was more important than Christmas. She said: 'We see it as more important than Christmas. It is such an important Cornish tradition, but if the children can not go how are we supposed to keep it alive? 'Obviously we celebrate Christmas, but the fact we see this as more important shows the scale of what it means to us. 'I will be taking the kids out as I strongly believe we should be allowed to keep our heritage alive. 'They all have a 100 per cent attendance record. I never take them out for a holiday. 'But everyone in Padstow takes part. People who once lived there come from the other side of the world to take part. It is in their blood.'\n",

            "Former Manchester City manager Sven Goran Eriksson delivered a damning verdict on his old club, claiming they should be winning the Premier League rather than battling to stay in the top four. City, whose current squad cost a total of £368million, host West Ham on Sunday but a Champions League spot next year is still in doubt with just four points separating them and fifth place Liverpool with six games to play. Eriksson, who was the last manager at City before the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour and his family, said they have underperformed given their financial clout. Yaya Toure wore a snood in training on Thursday despite it being the hottest week of the year . City were beaten 4-2 by fierce rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford last weekend . ‘With the squad City have they should do better,’ he said, ‘I think they have the best players in the Premier League, so they should be the best team, but they are not. They are out of the Champions League again and it looks like they will not win the Premier League this year. Now they have to concentrate to finish in the top four. I don't know what is going wrong but with the money they have spent they have to do better. I suppose it is not good enough.’ Almost £1billion has been spent in an attempt to turn City into a major force in Europe since the Mansour family took over in 2008. They have twice won the Premier League title since then and are current champions. But they are out of Europe, lost in the FA Cup to Middlesborough and have lost their last two league games, a painful 4-2 derby defeat to Manchester United and a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace. Eriksson, who is currently managing one of China’s top teams Shanghai SIPG, said the owners will expect silverware every season. Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson (centre) managed City in the 2007-08 season . ‘For these rich clubs whose owners invest a huge amount of money, they expect to win every year, but only one team can win the title. It is difficult to tell whether the players or manager is at fault because they won the league last year with the same players. It is hard to know what has made the difference this year. But City have come a long way in the last ten years. The year before I was there they were almost relegated. Now they have success and the fans should be happy. But expectations are high, and it is the same at Chelsea. They want their team to win all the time.’\n",

            "A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim, Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza — who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France — was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center)  and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van.\n",

            "Sky Sports’ drastic cost-cutting across the board after paying £11million a match to retain Premier League rights is being blamed for the demise of the Victory Shield, the home nations international Under 16 tournament. The FA announced this week that England are pulling out of the event with immediate effect in order to achieve a more varied fixture list, including more foreign opposition. England have pulled out of the home nations international Under 16 tournament . But it is understood this surprise move has been prompted by Sky allegedly withdrawing their title sponsorship as well as reducing live coverage and wanting further changes to the format and another backer found. Gareth Southgate, FA’s head of National Teams, said: ‘We feel due to the uncertainly around the Victory Shield and the potential changes suggested by Sky, it is a good time to review our fixtures and make an early decision.’ However, Sky say that their recommendations, including shortening the time between games, would have raised the profile of an historic competition that first took place in 1925 and whose notable players include Sir Stanley Matthews, Sir Bobby Charlton, Kenny Dalglish, Trevor Brooking, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. Meanwhile, Sky’s price hikes involving all their programming since almost breaking the bank by committing £4.2bn to Premier League football are significantly more than the Isleworth spin machine suggested. The variety bundle has gone up 7.1 per cent, sports by 4 per cent — double for Virgin cable subscribers — the HD pack by 9.8 per cent and the full total by 6.4 per cent .

            "Nicola Sturgeon this afternoon scoffed at claims by Labour leader Ed Miliband that he would never do a deal with the SNP to become Prime Minister - insisting he will 'change his tune' after the election. The Scottish First Minister said Mr Miliband simply 'won't have the votes to say that he is going to do what he likes come what may' and reiterated her call for Labour to 'work together to lock the Tories out'. It came after Mr Miliband this morning repeatedly insisted he would not enter into any deal with the SNP after the election - either as a formal Coalition or a looser pact to put him in Number 10. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine meet Hindu devotees at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple in Willesden Green, London today . The Labour leader's visit to the north London temple came after he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show he would not do any deals with the SNP . But Ms Sturgeon said 'I suspect Ed Miliband will change his tune once the votes are cast..' Labour is expected to suffer heavy losses in Scotland - where it won 41 seats in 2010 - with forecasts suggesting Ms Sturgeon's party could see as many as 50 MPs elected. The latest set of UK-wide polls indicate that the General Election race is still neck-and-neck, with the country heading for a probable hung parliament and coalition negotiations after May 7. Pressed on whether he would consider a confidence-and-supply deal with the SNP to ensure backing for a Queen's Speech and Budget if he failed to secure an overall majority, Mr Miliband said: 'I am not interested in deals, no.' The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'If it is a Labour government it will be a Labour Queen's Speech, it will be a Labour Budget. It will not be written by the SNP.' But Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: 'On May 8 once the votes are cast, once the people have cast their verdict, Ed Miliband, just like the rest of us, will have to respect the wishes of the people in a democratic election. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, visits Jump Gymnastics community club in Cumbernauld during a campaign event, Scotland . Ms Sturgeon launched the SNP's youth manifesto today as polls predicted the party would win a landslide victory on May 7 . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon speaking at a rally of female activists to launch the SNP's women's pledge today . 'If there is a minority government, if no party has an overall majority, then it's simply not possible to ignore the views of other parties - I know that, I was part of a minority government at the Scottish Parliament. 'So if the SNP has a large number of MPs, firstly we can use that clout to keep the Tories out, and secondly we can use it to ensure the Tories are replaced with something better, bolder and more progressive. 'If that remains the case on May 8 if he doesn't have a majority, what he will be saying to the people is rather than work with the SNP if there is an anti-Tory majority, he'd rather watch David Cameron waltz back into Downing Street. 'I don't want that and the SNP will use our votes to stop a Tory government getting off the ground if there is that anti-Tory majority.' Ms Sturgeon added: 'It's the people who are in charge and the politicians have to respect the democratic wishes of the people, if Ed Miliband doesn't get a majority, as the polls are all saying he won't, then he'll have to work with other parties.' David Cameron delivers a speech to party activists while campaigning in Norton Sub Hamdon near Yeovil today . Mr Cameron said he made 'no apology' for focussing on the threat posed by the SNP in the election next month . The latest opinion poll in Scotland shows Labour remains on course for heavy losses to the Scottish nationalists in its heartlands north of the border - keeping hold of as few as five seats. Just over a quarter  of Scots say they will be voting for Labour in the election, according to the Panelbase poll for The Sunday Times, down two on earlier in the month, with the SNP up three points to stand at 48 per cent. With the election now less than two weeks away, the Prime Minister and other leading Tories have stepped up their attacks on the SNP. David Cameron warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain' as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed'. In an escalation of his rhetoric about the dangers of the May 7 General Election producing a minority Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party, he told the Sunday Express that nationalist MPs would be hoping for a 'disaster' which would bring forward their dream of independence. Meanwhile, Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May told the Mail on Sunday that a Labour/SNP government could be 'the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication', when King Edward VIII gave up the throne in 1936. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Theresa May has made herself look completely and utterly stupid with ridiculous over the top comments like that. 'This is the same Theresa May that tried to tell the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign that if we voted Yes we would lose our passports and have border controls. 'People will look at these silly comments, and I was going to say they will treat them with contempt, but that actually attaches too much seriousness to them. People will just laugh at her.'\n",

            "Kolo Toure has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club, similar to the way that Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair did at Manchester City. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week, giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new £100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is 'quite flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City are also keen on English football's hottest property. But Toure, who used to play for  City with Rodwell and Sinclair, has warned his Anfield team-mate a move to one of European football's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of. Raheem Sterling has been warned about the dangers of leaving Liverpool by his team-mate Kolo Toure . Toure compared Sterling's situation with that of Jack Rodwell (left) and Scott Sinclair joining Manchester City . Toure (centre) says Liverpool is the best place for Sterling to stay and continue his development as a player . After starring in Everton's midfield and making his England debut, Jack Rodwell was being linked with every big club around. Sir Alex Ferguson was known to be an admirer but Rodwell was snapped up by Manchester City for £12million. Repeated injury problems and the presence of Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Javi Garcia saw his appearances limited, while Fernandinho arrived for £30m the next summer. After just seven league starts in two years, Rodwell moved on to relegation-threatened Sunderland for £10m. It was a similar story for Scott Sinclair. After powering Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League and scoring eight times in the top flight, Chelsea youth product Sinclair moved to City for £8m. But he too struggled with the competition in City's squad and moved to West Bromwich Albion on loan last season. He found it hard to break into the team there and returned to City before heading out on loan again to Aston Villa in January where he has found some form. Rodwell joined City in a £12million deal in 2012, while Sinclair made the same move from Swansea City for an £8m fee later that summer. The English pair made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances between them across two seasons at the Etihad Stadium. Rodwell joined relegation-threatened Sunderland last summer to end his City nightmare while Sinclair is trying to rebuild his career at Aston Villa. Toure says Sterling could be making a similar mistake by leaving Anfield. 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play,' Toure said. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he wouldn't be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. There is no messing at clubs like that.' Brendan Rodgers used his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Arsenal to reiterate that Sterling was not for sale, and Toure sees Liverpool as the perfect place for the 20-year-old to continue his development. 'I'm not surprised there's speculation because everybody would want to have a player like him,' he told the Liverpool ECHO. 'But he needs to stay here. Liverpool is a great place for him. Sterling stunned Liverpool this week, giving an interview confirming that he had turned down a new deal . The likes of Chelsea, City and Arsenal would have big competition in their squads for a place . 'This is definitely the best place for him to continue his development. At Liverpool, he's beginning to be one of the most important players. He's playing every week. 'If he went to another club there would be big challenges he would face. He wouldn't be the most important player.' Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Chelsea had joined the race to sign England star Sterling, with the Premier League leaders wanting to be kept informed of any developments in his contract situation. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also monitoring the developments in his stand-off at Anfield. Rodwell made just seven Premier League starts for City during his two-year spell before leaving the club . The former Everton man now plays for relegation-threatened Sunderland after a tough time at City . Sinclair's spell was even more difficult, he made just two league starts for City before moving out on loan . Sinclair is on loan at Aston Villa as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a young England talent . Doubts over Arsenal’s ability to fund a move have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him with the likes of Chelsea and City. Liverpool boss Rodgers said on Thursday: ‘He’s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he’s not going anywhere in the summer. 'I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn’t come into it. If the club doesn’t want to sell, it won’t sell, it’s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. ‘Whatever player - Raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club. ‘He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’re overly concerned about. I’m confident that at the end of the season we’ll find the solution.’ Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future . Sinclair spent more time on the bench than the pitch at City, and Toure thinks it could be similar for Sterling .\n",

            "Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United team-mate Marouane Fellaini has gone from Old Trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in Europe. Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'\n",

            "Derry Mathews has won the interim WBA lightweight title after being handed a unanimous points decision over Tony Luis in Liverpool. Mathews saw Richar Abril twice pull out of a fight due to illness to be striped of the belt and just this week replacement Ismael Barroso was forced to pull out after failing to obtain a visa. Derry Mathews celebrates after victory over Tony Luis at Echo Arena on Saturday night . Mathews celebrates with his family after claiming the interim WBA lightweight title . Luis was drafted in at the last minute and while the Canadian will have won a lot of fans with his relentless style, he did not win over the judges and Mathews was handed a 114-112, 114-112, 115-112 decision. Mathews made the brighter start and kept Luis contained behind the jab while landing a decent uppercut at the end of the second round. Mathews throws a right punch during interim WBA lightweight title fight in Liverpool . Luis (right) was drafted in after Richar Abril and Ismael Barroso both pulled out . The Liverpudlian continued to still largely control the fight but Luis showed plenty of aggression himself, coming forward and making life difficult for Mathews, landing a good uppercut of his own at the end of the sixth. Luis' pressure and all-action style was beginning to tell on Mathews, who was more and more often going to the ropes and both men were deducted a point in the eighth, Mathews for a low blow and Luis for use of the head. Luis was in the ascendency in the closing rounds and looked to be pulling some points back on the cards but it was not enough as Mathews was handed a tight decision after a thrilling encounter.\n",

            "It's hard to know quite what motivated the Duke of York to rescue teenage sex slaves in India at the same time he faced damning allegations that he had slept with one in America. But one thing is for certain: it definitely took guts. With a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion, it can be revealed that Prince Andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in Calcutta. Rescued from brothels and domestic servitude, child labour and human trafficking, the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called Key to Freedom. Moved: Prince Andrew during his visit to an Indian refuge in 2012, which inspired him to form the charity . Their kimonos, duster coats, pyjamas, scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the British High Street by Topshop, with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary. What makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after Andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with American ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts, who had been working for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire. The claims, furiously denied by the Duke, have now been struck out of American court records, effectively clearing his name. He was inspired to launch Key to Freedom after visiting a girls’ refuge on an official trip to India. He came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the Women’s Interlink Foundation and swiftly donated £10,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, the Duke said: ‘I was incredibly impressed with the work of the Women’s Interlink Foundation during my Diamond Jubilee visit to India in May 2012. ‘I could see that it would be possible to complement [founder and chairman] Aloka Mitra’s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products. It is incredible to see what the team has achieved. Roberts had been working for Andrew's former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire (pictured together above) ‘I am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the United Kingdom. ‘Most importantly, this has helped the Women’s Interlink Foundation support more young people to develop skills, which is an important area of focus for my work.’ One of the young women who moved him so deeply was Anita, now 19. She was chosen to show the Duke how to block-print silk when he visited the refuge. In return, he left two copies of Little Red’s Summer Adventure, a book written by his former wife Sarah. The child of two tea garden labourers from northern Bengal, Anita was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends. Lured to New Delhi with the promise of a job to help her support her family, she escaped only to find herself living as a ‘railway child’ at the city’s station. Illiterate and destitute, she had no way home until she was taken in by the WIF where she met the Duke on his trip. She was among the first girls to sign up to Key to Freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees – approximately £430 – supplying silk goods to Topshop. She has also been reunited with her family near Darjeeling. ‘We traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted,’ revealed Aloka. ‘Once we had told them her real story and that she’d learned English and Bengali and maths, and that she had a craft and was earning a living, they changed their mind.’ Anita said: ‘I am doing well now and so is my mother. She was sick and I have been able to pay for medical treatment for her. ‘I have earned almost 40,000 rupees through Key to Freedom and I have a skill which will help my future. I hope I keep getting orders for my work. I hope it won’t stop.’ Prince Andrew’s 25-year-old daughter, Princess Eugenie, and his former wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have both paid private visits to help support the charity, and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative. The Duke’s eldest daughter Beatrice, 26, was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months, although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in New York. Eugenie also works in the city for an online auction house. Other workers with Key to Freedom include Taralika, 25, who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home. ‘She was locked up in a brothel and beaten, and then starved for days for refusing to have sex,’ said Aloka. Profits: About £20,000 from Topshop sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their UK stores . ‘Finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police. She was, and still remains, mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she’s making excellent progress. She is happy and confident working as a tailor.’ Another Key to Freedom success story is Shila, 21, an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of Calcutta. Aloka said: ‘She now has a bank account like any other working woman. It has totally changed her life. ‘Poverty makes these women victims. They suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn. They live with abuse – mental, physical and sexual – just to be certain of food and shelter. ‘The Duke understood that and wanted to make a difference – as the father of two daughters I think the plight of the girls here resonated with him. ‘He wanted to given them their independence. Handmade: A silk Topshop kimono . ‘There was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit. The only thing he asked me was, “What do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls?” ‘I spoke to him about alternative income earning, a regular outlet to sell their work, and skills development to make their craft more marketable. His aides called less than an hour after he’d left and set up a meeting the same night. ‘He had already spoken to the Duchess of York about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could. The name Key to Freedom was her idea.’ Aloka added: ‘While I understood that their heart was in the right place, I also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought. ‘Not only did they find the time, they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today. ‘It was Prince Andrew’s skills at connecting businesses that linked us to Topshop. It’s nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the UK.’ Aloka came to London for talks with the Duke’s team at Buckingham Palace just three months after their initial meeting, and by summer 2013 Key to Freedom was up and running. It fulfilled its first order to Topshop, every piece individually signed by the woman who made it, in July 2013. Since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold. Yesterday, the High Street giant, which sent designer Penny McIvor to India to assist with colours, patterns and quality control, confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year. Topshop declined to discuss sales figures, but it is understood around £20,000 has so far been paid by the company, which makes no profit from the scheme, to the Prince Andrew Charitable Foundation. This then sends the money back to Key to Freedom in Calcutta. In addition, the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of Prince Andrew’s Pitch@Palace events for entrepreneurs last month, where 200 of its scarves were also on sale. The scheme is another of his business-to-business initiatives uniting start-ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors, venture capitalists and mentors. A Buckingham Palace source said that the Prince remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity – such as Pitch@Palace – to promote it. ‘It’s been completely empowering for the girls here,’ said Aloka. ‘It’s about honour and dignity, and having control over their own future. ‘It means they can look ahead and put their past behind them.’\n",

            "Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francisco Totti to move continents and join him at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors. The 29-year-old moved to his current side on a loan deal from Southampton and has become an instant hit - scoring three goals in six games. Osvaldo believes that the duo would be a good fit for Boca, and says the fans would love to have them line up on the La Bombonera pitch. Pablo Osvaldo thinks that his former team-mates Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti should move to Boca . 'Who I would like to join me at Boca? Pirlo and Totti,' the 29-year-old told Corriere dello Sport. 'I have played with many great players over the years and many of them are my friends. I don't want to do injustice to anyone, but if I had to pick two, it would be Pirlo and Totti. 'They have a bit of a South-American style and they would be perfect for Boca with their abilities. 'The Bombonera would go absolutely crazy for players like them.' Pirlo has established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football and is hugely popular . Totti (10) is a Roma legend and Osvaldo feels that he would be just as loved if he moved to Argentina .\n",

            "British banker Rurik Jutting appeared before a packed courtroom in Hong Kong on Thursday accused of the murder of two young Indonesian women whose mutilated bodies were found in his apartment. Wearing the same black T-shirt and dark-rimmed glasses as in previous hearings, Jutting, 30, returned to magistrates' court after being deemed fit to stand trial in November following psychiatric tests. The former Merrill Lynch Bank of America employee faces life in prison if he is convicted of the murder charges. British banker Rurik Jutting (L), charged with grisly murders of two women, sits in a prison van as he arrives at the eastern court in Hong Kong, on April 2 . Jutting is accused of the murders of two Indonesian women. His case has been adjourned for five weeks . But the case was adjourned until May 8 after the prosecution asked for more time. One-time securities trader Jutting, who has not yet entered a plea in the case, was attentive but looked tired. He spoke twice to say: 'I do' when asked whether he understood the two charges against him. Seneng Mujiasih and Sumarti Ningsih, both in their 20s, were found dead in Jutting's upmarket flat in the early hours of November 1 after he called police. Mujiasih was found in the living room, naked and with knife wounds to her legs and buttocks. The decaying body of Ningsih was found hours later in a suitcase on the balcony. High-flying Cambridge graduate Jutting is being held at Hong Kong's maximum security Siu Lam psychiatric prison -- a walled hilltop compound on the outskirts of Hong Kong. Defence counsel Tim Parker accused the prosecution of \"yo-yo-ing\" for initially saying that they would need until July to present a case, then coming back to court, only to delay once more. 'It was an unnecessary waste of cost... My client was forced to come here,' said Parker, who added that the prosecution had sent the defence its committal papers - the case documents - too late. Magistrate Jason Wan turned down an application for costs, saying that it was 'not unusual' for a complex case to take time. Once all the evidence is submitted, after being reviewed by both sides, the magistrate will commit the case to the High Court, which handles murder cases and where an official plea must be entered. In a city generally regarded as safe by residents and known for its high-end shops and glitzy skyscrapers, the killings were unusually brutal and shone a spotlight on the seedy underbelly of the finance hub. Police have said they were investigating whether the two women were sex workers after cocaine and sex toys were found in the apartment, just a few streets away from Hong Kong's red-light district, where Jutting was reportedly a regular. But their distraught parents told AFP they believed their children had been working at restaurants. Mujiasih had entered the city on a domestic worker visa in 2010, but that had lapsed in 2012, while Ningsih came in on a tourist visa in October last year.\n",

            "Controversial Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary claims the budget airline will slash its fares by as much as 15 per cent over the next two years. The chief executive of Europe’s largest budget airline made the vow in an interview with a French weekly newspaper, saying its average fare could be as low as €40 (approximately £26) next year. It would be a €6 (£4) decrease from Ryanair’s current average ticket price, with Mr O’Leary attributing the anticipated fare cuts to lower oil prices. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary took aim at Air France in his interview with Le Journal du Dimanche . Famed for his combative management style, Mr O’Leary told Le Journal du Dimanche the Dublin-based discount carrier will pass the oil savings on to customers and claimed most European airlines have an average ticket price of €170 for a short flight. He said Ryanair expects to grow its passenger numbers and cut costs with new Boeing aircraft that will have more seats and reduce fuel consumption by an average of 18 per cent – without compromising passenger safety or security. In his interview with the Sunday newspaper the airline boss, who has made strides to soften his image, took shots at Air France, touting Ryanair as a cheaper and more reliable airline. He ridiculed Air France for last year’s pilots’ strike, which reportedly cost the Paris-based carrier hundreds of millions of pounds, predicted more troubled times and accused the airline of impeding growth at regional airports. An Air France spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that the airline is not responding to Mr O'Leary's comments. Michael O'Leary said he despises the 'French political class', but loves France and the French . Mr O’Leary was put on the defensive several times in the wide-ranging interview, as he disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages. The chief executive claimed there is a waiting list of 300 pilots and nearly 1,000 flight attendants who want to work for Ryanair. He told the newspaper: ‘All the things we hear about Ryanair are nonsense. Many companies such as Air France cut jobs. We create, we increase salaries and we pay pension contributions.’ Mr O’Leary also had to explain his feelings towards the French, telling Le Journal du Dimanche that he ‘despises the French political class’ that ‘destroyed the economy’, but loves France and the French. The airline boss disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages . He defended Ryanair’s decision not to employ workers in France year-round, saying it is due to the ‘administrative madness’ of labour laws and taxation. Ryanair has long faced complaints of poor customer service and excessive surcharges, but recently launched a marketing push to win over customers and has eased some of its fees or restrictions. It operates 31 airports in France, and Mr O’Leary said its Paris hub will continue to be Beauvais-Tilly, about 55 miles north of the French capital. He said acquiring slots at Charles de Gaulle or Paris Orly airports – which are hubs for Air France-KLM and their subsidiaries – presents an expensive challenge.\n",

            "Dr Christopher Valentine (pictured) used his iPod to take illicit photos of patients, a tribunal heard . A doctor who was allowed to continue working after taking intimate photographs of patients has been caught doing it again, it emerged yesterday. Dr Christopher Valentine, 52, was sacked from a sexual health clinic and hauled before the General Medical Council nine years ago for photographing half-naked male and female patients without consent. His behaviour was branded ‘inappropriate’ but he was not struck off and went to work at an NHS service for drug addicts and alcoholics. However, the married doctor has been caught again after a nurse saw images of a semi-naked man on his iPod Touch during a night out. Fiona White was stunned to find the pictures while looking at others he had taken of colleagues at a a leaving do. Valentine told her the image – which appeared to be of a man’s genitals – was of a patient’s heroin injection site, but Miss White and another nurse who saw it were suspicious and decided to report him to his boss. Yesterday, the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal in Manchester heard that Miss White saw the pictures on the iPod in April 2013 at a leaving party for a member of Clydebank Community Addiction Team, a unit led by Valentine that treats addicts near Glasgow. Giving evidence at the fitness-to-practise hearing, Miss White said: ‘He started taking photographs around the table and I asked to have a look at them. He handed me the device and I scrolled through and saw photos of people at the table and came across a photo of his cat. ‘I kept going and came across a photo of what I would describe as a male groin. I didn’t look close but I remember getting such a shock.’ Miss White gasped at the image, prompting her colleague Maria Forrester, who was sitting next to her, to look at the iPod, too. Mrs Forrester, a senior addiction nurse, said: ‘In the blink of an eye I could see what she had reacted to. It looked like it was a part of a male body. She seemed quite startled. A nurse was swiping through photographs of Dr Valentine's pets when she came across an image of a semi-naked man, a tribunal . ‘I remember Dr Valentine saying these were pictures of injection sites. I think I did see genitals.’ Mrs Forrester said she met Miss White later to discuss their concerns, adding: ‘There was a consensus that both of us had seen a naked image of part of a male’s body. 'I was concerned that patients were being photographed without consent. I thought I had to report this. 'I couldn’t think of any reason why that doctor would have pictures of patients’ groins.’ Valentine told his boss he took the photos for teaching purposes and used his iPod because he was unable to use NHS equipment. The fitness to practice hearing took place at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (pictured) in Manchester . But an investigation found he used the device to take 53 photos, some of vulnerable patients of both sexes. Some were stored on his home computer. More than half had been deleted when the iPod was seized and had to be retrieved by IT specialists. Valentine, of Dunoon, west Scotland, admitted ten allegations of taking photographs without medical reason or consent and showing them to colleagues. He denied lying to his boss about how many he had taken and keeping them on his device until August 2013. The hearing continues.\n",

            "A former Portuguese detective was today ordered to pay nearly £360,000 to Kate and Gerry McCann after a long-running libel trial. Goncalo Amaral had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter Madeleine's disappearance. In a written verdict, a Lisbon court agreed that Amaral should pay Mr and Mrs McCann €250,000 (£179,000) each in damages and banned further sales of his book The Truth Of The Lie. The couple's lawyer Isabel Duarte also revealed that Amaral had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at €106,000 (£76,000). Scroll down for video . Kate and Gerry McCann have reportedly been awarded £360,000 in damages from an ex-Portuguese detective who wrote a book claiming their daughter Madeleine had died in an accident instead of being abducted . Police chief Goncalo Amaral (above) ran the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . Madeleine was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Mr Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008. He later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed that Madeleine was dead, that there had been no abduction and the McCanns had hidden her body. The couple, who accuse Amaral of hampering the search for their daughter, had been expected to receive around £1million in damages. Amaral's lawyers have leave to appeal the ruling. The McCanns told the court last summer they were left 'devastated and crushed' by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine's twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn't know the detail. Amaral claimed Madeleine (above) had not been abducted, but had died in an accident in Praia da Luz . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: 'I believe that's what's in Mr Amaral's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. 'To a child, it could be very damaging.' Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: 'I was devastated. 'It made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice I felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole. 'It was very painful to read and I felt sad for Madeleine. I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing in Portugal.' She went on to accuse Amaral, thrown off the investigation in 2007 for criticising British police, of 'consistently smearing' them. She also claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter's whereabouts. A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl. Mystery: British police shift through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in June last year during their investigation into her disappearance . The Metropolitan Police was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to David Cameron in 2011. Since Madeleine vanished, every possible theory has been explored, including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile or killed during a botched burglary. Others include being snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident. However, not one shred of proof of what happened to Madeleine has been uncovered. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who took over Operation Grange in December, and her team travelled to Portugal to interview seven suspects and four witnesses, but have not released any information about what they discovered. Portuguese prosecutors also reopened their probe into Madeleine's disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by Scotland Yard.\n",

            "Matt Dunford, 30, who claimed to be 'Britain's vainest man', has been ordered to carry out 120 hours unpaid work for harassing an ex-girlfriend, pictured today outside court . A fitness fanatic dubbed 'Britain's vainest man' who set up a fake website claiming his ex-girlfriend was a prostitute has been ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work for harassing her. Matt Dunford, 30, bombarded Brazilian model Amanda Branco with up to 50 messages a day and tried to blackmail her out of £5,000 after their six-month relationship broke down. When she refused to pay the bodybuilder, from Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, he mocked-up an escort website profile on Facebook and sent it to her mother and sister. Dunford failed to appear at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court in February but was found guilty of two counts of harassment without violence in his absence. The model, who claims he spends £100,000-a-year on his looks and is now working as a stripper, says he took an overdose and suffered a seizure days before the hearing, causing him to miss it. Sentencing him today, Amanda Barron, chair of the bench, said: 'It involves two periods of harassment over a long period of time, it also involves harassment electronically and wide dissemination. 'This has had caused a great deal of distress for the complainant and possible impact on her work. 'We have decided that these two offences are serious enough to sentence you to a community order.' Dunford, dressed in a black jacket, a multi-coloured scarf, and black trousers, was given a 12 month community order and told to do 120 hours of unpaid work. Ms Barron added: 'We also decided we are going to impose a restraining order, we feel it's a necessary precaution.' The pair had met in Ireland and then went on to work at the same branch of Gymbox in Holborn, central London but the six month relationship ended in October 2013. The personal trainer bombarded Ms Branco, from Rio de Janeiro, with calls, texts and emails, then tried to blackmail her - although the blackmail did not form part of the harassment charge. She estimated she was receiving at least 30 phone calls and 50 text messages a day from Dunford trying to get her to meet up with him. Giving evidence Ms Branco told magistrates: 'I went to Brazil for three months to get away from him. The day I got back - I don't know how he found out - he left me a voicemail screaming \"Are you back, are you back, are you back?\" 'He kept asking me to meet him, he said he had problems with drugs and needed my friendship to move on and go back to the gym and move on my life. I was getting 30 calls a day.' Brazilian model Amanda Branco (pictured left and right) says her ex-boyfriend bombarded her with messages and calls and even set up a fake escort profile of her and sent it to her mother and sister . She added: 'In February 2014 he said he found out I wasn't just a stripper, [he thought] I was an escort. 'He started blackmailing me, saying he wanted £5,000 for what I did to his life. I felt scared and then he started saying if you don't reply, wait and watch what is going to happen. 'He said you have until midnight and he gave me an address for a hotel just five minutes from my house.' Ms Branco told the court: 'He photoshopped a website saying I was an escort, he sent it to my mum and my sister.' Describing the harassment Doreen Bogle, prosecuting,said in one text message Dunford said: 'I think you need to go back to Brazil, you are hurting too many people here,' The fitness fanatic once said he spends more than £100,000 on his beauty regime, including £18,000 on clothes and £10,800 on his hair . Dunford had denied two charges of harassment without violence but was found guilty at an earlier hearing and today told to pay a £120 victim surcharge and £920 in costs. He's also banned from contacting Ms Branco . In another text he said: 'Police hate escorts, they're all druggies and liars.' Miss Bogle said Dunford had also emailed a friend called Alex, saying Branco was 'pure evil, she literally tried to ruin me.' He added: 'She's a disgrace, I'm going to make sure she's deported back to Brazil, I have Jack Tweedy's lawyer working for me.' He also posted a Facebook message 'referring to her as an escort, a prostitute, and a drug user,' said Ms Bogle. The World Beauty Fitness & Fashion World Championship contestant called police when Dunford arrived her flat demanding to be let in - claiming he wanted to collect his nutritional supplements. Dunford's career, which the court heard he has worked 'exceptionally hard' for 12 years for, has been left 'literally in tatters' - with only two fitness clients remaining. His barrister, Jess Ward, said Dunford took an overdose the day before he was found guilty of a charge of harassment last month. He suffered a seizure and was unable to talk because he had violently chewed the inside of his mouth during the convulsion. Dunford's (right) barrister said his life had been left 'literally in tatters' after the charges were brought against him by Ms Branco (left) and he is now living at home with his parents in Bedfordshire. Dunford was only discharged at 1am on 2 February, where he returned to his parents' house in Leighton Buzzard. In the meantime he has been convalescing with his father, who is a retired GP, and his mother, who is a nurse. Dunford had denied the charges but was ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge and £920 in costs. Magistrates also placed a restraining order on Dunford and ordered that he does not contact Ms Branco. He was told the order will remain in place until further order is made.\n",

            "Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today. The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government. An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow. Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ding-dong: Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming — the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers. But Comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions. 'Washington's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company,' wrote analyst Craig Moffett in a client email. 'For all intents and purposes, their M&A ambitions would be on ice in the U.S.' Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3052969/Reports-say-Comcast-plans-drop-45B-Time-Warner-Cable-bid.html#ixzz3YAkxSfYl Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook .\n",

            "As California struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta — and the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations. A state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that supply water to arid farmland in the Central Valley and to millions of residents as far south as San Diego. Delta farmers don't deny using as much water as they need. But they say they're not stealing it because their history of living at the water's edge gives them that right. Still, they have been asked to report how much water they're pumping and to prove their legal rights to it. Scroll down for video . Drought: In this photo taken Friday March 27, 2015, low-flow water emitter sits on some of the dry, cracked ground of farmer Rudy Mussi's  almond orchard in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta near Stockton, California . Resources: Rudy Mussi watches his grandson, Lorenzo, 20 months, tries to turn a water valve on his almond orchard  in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (March 2015 file photo) At issue is California's century-old water rights system that has been based on self-reporting and little oversight, historically giving senior water rights holders the ability to use as much water as they need, even in drought. Gov. Jerry Brown has said that if drought continues this system built into California's legal framework will probably need to be examined. Delta farmer Rudy Mussi says he has senior water rights, putting him in line ahead of those with lower ranking, or junior, water rights. 'If there's surplus water, hey, I don't mind sharing it,' Mussi said. 'I don't want anybody with junior water rights leapfrogging my senior water rights just because they have more money and more political clout.' The fight pitting farmer against farmer is playing out in the Delta, the hub of the state's water system. With no indication of the drought easing, heightened attention is being placed on dwindling water throughout the state, which produces nearly half of the fruits, nuts and vegetables grown in the U.S. A large inland estuary east of San Francisco, the Delta is fed by rivers of freshwater flowing down from the Sierra Nevada and northern mountain ranges. Located at sea level, it consists of large tracts of farmland separated by rivers that are subject to tidal ebbs and flows. Most of the freshwater washes out to the Pacific Ocean through the San Francisco Bay. Some is pumped — or diverted — by Delta farmers to irrigate their crops, and some is sent south though canals to Central Valley farmers and to 25 million people statewide. The drought now in its fourth year has put Delta water under close scrutiny. Twice last year state officials feared salty bay water was backing up into the Delta, threatening water quality. There was not enough fresh water to keep out saltwater. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater . In June, the state released water stored for farmers and communities from Lake Oroville to combat the saltwater intrusion. Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said 'thousands of acre-feet of water a day for a couple of weeks' were released into the Delta. An acre-foot is roughly enough water to supply a household of four for a year. The fact that the state had to resort to using so much from storage raised questions about where the water was going. That in turn prompted a joint letter by the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation calling for an investigation into how much water Delta farmers are taking — and whether the amount exceeds their rights to it. 'We don't know if there were illegal diversions going on at this time,' said Vogel, leaving it up to officials at the State Water Resources Control Board to determine. 'Right now, a large information gap exists.' Some 450 farmers who hold 1,061 water rights in the Delta and the Sacramento and San Joaquin river watersheds were told to report their water diversions, and Katherine Mrowka, state water board enforcement manager, said a vast majority responded. State officials are sorting through the information that will help them determine whether any are exceeding their water rights and who should be subject to restrictions. 'In this drought period, water accounting is more important to ensure that the water is being used for its intended purpose,' said U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spokesman Louis Moore. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer whose family grows tomatoes, wheat, corn, grapes and almonds on 4,500 acres west of Stockton, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater. 'All of a sudden they're trying to turn their water into a permanent system and ours temporary,' Mussi said. 'It's just not going to work.' Shawn Coburn farms 1,500 acres along the San Joaquin River in Firebaugh about 100 miles south of the Delta. As a senior rights holder, he figures he will receive 45 percent or less of the water he expected from the federal water project. On another 1,500 acres where he is a junior water rights holder, he will receive no surface water for a second consecutive year. 'I don't like to pick on other farmers, even if it wasn't a drought year,' said Coburn. 'The only difference is I don't have a pipe in the Delta I can suck willy-nilly whenever I want.'\n",

            "(CNN)I'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops.\n",

            "A Spanish town on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route is warning pilgrims and other visitors to stop defecating along the famous path. Graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of Santiago de Compostela, in north-western Spain, have been erected in the municipality of Lastres. But no one knows who put up the signs, which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it. Someone in the municipality of Lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail . The pilgrimage, known as the Way of St James, attracts thousands of pilgrims every year, but there can be very few places to go when nature calls. In Lastres, angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes. The signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter. The pilgrimage begins at various points, with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the Spain-France border, which lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where Saint James the Great is said to be buried. Antonio Fernandez, a resident of Lastres, told Spain’s EFE news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction. Some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles (800 kilometres) to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela . Pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them, he added. Two other residents, Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife, Maria Paz, said they were surprised the warning signs were posted, as the pilgrims ‘are very polite’ and ‘always friendly’. Lantres is a parish in Santos, and its mayor said ‘it makes no sense’ that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route. Julio Gallego told the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia that it is a ‘huge failure’ that needs to be remedied.\n",

            "Two mistakes from Rangers keeper Robby McCrorie handed Celtic the Glasgow Cup as they clinched the trophy for the fourth time in eight seasons at Hampden. Josh Kerr took advantage when the Scotland under-17 star came for a corner and missed it to put the Hoops in front before McCrorie dropped a Mark Hill free kick over the line. With Old Firm bosses Ronny Deila and Stuart McCall looking on, it was the former who left happiest after seeing Tommy McIntyre’s side record a deserved victory. Celtic U17 players celebrate after beating Rangers 2-0 to win the Glasgow Cup at Hampden . Celtic goalscorer Josh Kerr holds the trophy in the air as he celebrates on Tuesday evening . Both teams line up ahead of the match which was played behind closed doors at Hampden Park . And as only local schoolkids and their parents were allowed in following trouble among fans at the last three finals, the match passed without any major off-field problems. Rangers took the game to their opponents but early headers from Aiden Wilson and Ross McCrorie ran past either post. Celtic hit back and began to dictate play, sitting further up the park the more time wore on and pressing well for an opener. Nine days after the Parkhead club’s first team was denied a clear penalty in the Scottish Cup against Inverness, their youths had another good claim. But Kyle Bradley’s handball in the box from a Regan Hendry shot went unnoticed by referee Stephen Graham before the midfielder fired the rebound straight at Robby McCrorie. Calvin Miller then shot just over from 20 yards, Hendry was denied again by McCrorie and Miller screwed another long-range drive inches wide as the Hoops looked more likely to net. Kerr fires the ball into the net to give Celtic the lead against Rangers in the 74th minute . Kerr slides along the Hampden pitch in celebration after putting Celtic ahead . Mark Hill (third left) is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling Celtic's lead . Just when it seemed they would get themselves in front, Hendry nodded past from close range when Miller picked him out with a great right-wing cross and it was a poor miss. Rangers were being restricted to playing on the counter and offered little in attack, with a low Ross Lyon shot that ran tamely wide being as close as they came. It took some strong defending to keep them level at the break too, with two last-gasp tackles from Wilson and Ross McCrorie being just enough to deny Hendry. Celtic kept pressing after the restart, with Theo Archibald firing a volley over and Rory Currie’s low attempt flashing off target. They almost paid for their slackness in front of goal, with Gers’ Sam Jamieson forcing a terrific tip over the bar from keeper Ross Doohan. Celtic manager Ronny Deila watches the U17 side claim victory in the Glasgow Cup . Rangers manager Stuart McCall (centre), assistant Kenny Black (left) and goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart watch the match from the stands at Hampden . The Light Blues took heart from that and began coming forward more but were just as sloppy with their finishing as Wilson nodded a Lyon corner over. Celtic responded once again, with Robby McCrorie smothering Mark Hill’s attempt, Dan Higgins aiming too high from 20 yards and McCrorie gathering Archibald’s grasscutter. Rangers made their best chances through Lyon and substitute Jamie Barjonas but rued their misses as Celtic scored twice in as many minutes and McCrorie was culpable both times. Celtic players celebrate in the dressing room at the national stadium in Glasgow . He failed to take Hendry’s corner when he tried to claim it with 16 minutes left and Kerr lashed in the loose ball from four yards. McCrorie’s error moments later was worse, however, as he fumbled into the net when a flighted Hill free kick came in from wide on the left. Rangers tried to get back into the game and Jamieson came closest but Doohan kept him out and that sealed Celts’ success.\n",

            "A woman who was arrested and charged with manslaughter for a crash that caused the death of a 5-year-old child showed no remorse for her actions according to court records. Aaronessa Keaton of Phoenix, Arizona was eight months pregnant and had marijuana and Benzodiazepines in her system when she collided head-on with a car carrying two children in February 2014, and one of the children later died from their injuries. When told of this after her arrest, Keaton, 24, said; 'Sh*t happens.' Aaronessa Keaton (above) was arrested Monday and charged with manslaughter for a 2014 accident that resulted in the death of a 5-year-old child . Keaton hit another car head-on (above) while she was eight months pregnant and had marijuana and Benzodiazepines in her system . Keaton, who was also on probation for marijuana possession charges at the time, was indicted by a grand jury in February, and taken in Monday after she was pulled over for a traffic stop. According to CBS 5, Keaton was driving southbound on February 28, 2014 when she swiped a car going north, and she then continued across the northbound lane until she struck a 2007 Nissan Frontier. That car contained the child whose injuries were so severe they later died. The other child in the car was in serious condition, but later made a full recovery, and both adults in the front seat suffered only minor injuries. Keaton was also rushed to the hospital where an emergency C-section was performed.

            "Menacing: An immigrant holds his machete to his face as gangs clashed with police following the outbreak of violence in South Africa . Police battled to contain a wave of violence in South Africa last night as gangs of migrants armed themselves with machetes to fight off anti-foreigner attacks by locals. Five people have died since vigilantes started looting and attacking shops owned by immigrants, mainly from other parts of Africa. Police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets as immigrant gangs confronted the vigilantes, and last night in parts of Johannesburg officers formed a human barrier to keep the two sides apart. More than 200 immigrants had to take refuge in a police station and dozens of businesses were closed when trouble spread just a day after a rally against xenophobia in Durban. Immigrants have complained about a lack of protection from the authorities and some have started arming themselves to fight back. Eyewitnesses have claimed that the vigilante violence is carefully orchestrated and that minibuses have been ferrying men armed with knives and machetes around suburbs. In the past two weeks, shops and homes owned by Somalis, Ethiopians, Malawians and other migrants have been targeted, forcing more than 2,000 to flee to camps protected by armed guards. In Johannesburg, Malawian immigrant Samuel Idrssa described how his friend was stabbed and set on fire by a mob. ‘We wanted to rescue him but there were too many of them,’ he said. ‘It was shocking.’ He added: ‘We have all left our homes. Those affected are those of us who live in poor townships because we live with poor South Africans who do not have jobs.’ So far, five people are believed to have been killed in the violent protests which started two weeks ago in Durban, a key port on South Africa's Indian Ocean coast, spreading to Johannesburg. Violence flared days after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said in remarks reported by local media that foreigners should 'take their bags and go'. In a recorded speech sent to a local broadcaster, he said: 'We must deal with our own lice' and complained about foreign-owned shops. He has since said his comments were misinterpreted. Addressing parliament in Cape Town on Thursday, President Zuma reiterated his condemnation of the violence, calling it a 'violation' of South Africa's values. 'No amount of frustration or anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals and the looting of their shops,' he said. 'We condemn the violence in the strongest possible terms. The attacks violate all the values that South Africa embodies.' Scroll down for video . Fighting back: Immigrants carrying machetes have clashed with police in a search for locals that attacked foreign shop owners in Durban .

He also said the government was taking steps to secure its porous borders and making progress in setting up a Border Management Agency, announced last year and scheduled to be up and running in 2016. The ruling African National Congress party has condemned the attacks as 'shameful' and branded them 'criminal acts against vulnerable people'. The US ambassador to South Africa, born in Zaire - now the Democratic Republic of the Congo - to Haitian parents, spoke in defence of the immigrants. 'As an immigrant to my own country, my heart goes out to those who have been attacked for being different,' Patrick H. Gaspard said. The Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, which campaigns for peace, warned: ‘The fabric of the nation is splitting at the seams; its precious nucleus – our moral core – is being ruptured.’ Gang: A group of immigrants brandishing machetes in a run-down area of Johannesburg prepare to defend themselves against the police .

In the past two weeks, foreign nationals living near Johannesburg had to remove items from their shops and shut up their stores because of fears they could be targeted by protesters. They fled after a mobile phone text message was apparently sent to shop owners, warning them to shut their premises, claiming that 'Zulu people are coming to town... to kill every foreigner on the road'. Angry South Africans accuse immigrants of taking jobs in a country where unemployment and poverty levels are high - the official figure is 25 per cent but economists say, in reality, it is much higher.

In Actonville, South African men were seen singing, armed with clubs and pieces of wood, as they called for foreign shop owners to leave . Police responded to the violence in South Africa by firing tear gas grenades as they began to enter men's hostels to search for weapons . South Africa has a population of about 50 million, but an estimated five million immigrants and its high jobless rate, widespread poverty and glaring income disparities make it a ripe candidate for outbreaks of anti-immigrant violence. Johannesburg was the epicentre of the 2008 xenophobic attacks that killed more than 60 people and saw violence spread through the area.

            "'Boring' has been the word on everyone's lips when talking about Chelsea this week, but Didier Drogba has shown he and his team-mates still have the skill to disprove that disparaging tag. The Blues are preparing for Wednesday night's trip to Leicester City at St George's Park, having drawn criticism for the way they ground out a decisive 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday. And Drogba and his team-mates, who can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more victories, have shown off their abilities with an intricate six-man heading trick around the dinner table. Didier Drogba hit back at claims that Chelsea were boring with a video of them completing a 'bin challenge' After the ball is headed by Loic Remy and Eden Hazard, John Terry heads to Drogba in the six-man task . After Drogba, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is the next to take the ball, heading back to John Obi Mikel . Mikel stoops with a diving header that sees him fall off his chair, but the ball does drop into the small bin . Manager Jose Mourinho shot back at claims that his side were boring this week, insisting that going 10 years without winning the league - as Arsenal have - was more boring, and now Drogba has added to the retort with a video captioned: 'Boring boring chelseaaaa!!!!!!' With six players seated opposite each other on either side of a long table, Branislav Ivanovic throws the ball on to the head of Loic Remy to start the game. He heads back to Eden Hazard, who then directs it on to John Terry followed by Drogba and Thibaut Courtois before John Obi Mikel stoops to knock the ball into a bin with a diving header. After just about managing to complete the feat all seven players celebrate wildly, the sort of scenes that might be seen against Crystal Palace on Sunday if Chelsea win at the King Power Stadium and then on their return to Stamford Bridge. The champions-elect have been preparing for Wednesday night's game at the National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent since Monday, where they are staying at the on-site Hilton Hotel. While French forward Remy was more than willing to jump around with his team-mates in the video at the hotel, he has been ruled out of the game against Leicester by  Mourinho. With Mikel on the floor, Courtois and Terry leap into the air in celebrations that could soon be repeated . The seven players involved in the game at St George's Park jump around in a celebratory huddle . Drogba and his team-mates can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more league victories . Diego Costa is also a doubt having missed almost a month of action with a hamstring problem that has bugged him for much of the season. Midfielder Oscar has a chance of returning from the concussion he suffered against Arsenal in a challenge by goalkeeper David Ospina on Sunday. St George's Park, which opened in October 2012, is used by the full range of England teams as well as club sides. Barcelona, Galatasaray and Monaco are among the visiting teams to have stayed there. Terry and his team-mates celebrate at full-time at the Emirates Stadium after stepping closer to the title .\n",

            "A nine-year-old girl was attacked by a lion that was being walked like a dog by circus entertainers who had brought their show to a quiet Siberian village. The girl is in hospital after she was savaged by the animal in Namtsy, in the Sakha Republic in Siberia - one of the coldest regions in the world. Photographs show the lion being walked around by a worker for a circus that had been visiting the village. A lion that appeared to be being walked like a dog around the Siberian village of Namtsy attacked a child . In one picture an entertainer crouches down next to the lion, surrounded by snow. In another she is shown walking the animal and appears to be attempting to drag it across a wet and icy road using a makeshift leash. The circus is believed to have left Namtsy - also known as Yakutia - abruptly after the incident. The girl was walking home from music school with her mother when she was attacked, the Siberian Times reported. Gavril Kolpashnikov, the girl's father, said: 'I was fishing, and got back at night. I saw my child in a horrible condition. To put it mildly, stressed. She's shocked. 'The child is still shaking, she's not of those brave kids.' The nine-year-old girl was reportedly savaged by the lion, and was taken to hospital for treatment . The circus is believed to have abruptly left the village - one of the coldest places in the world - after the attack . He added: 'They were walking their animal as if it was a dog.' It has not been confirmed how badly injured the girl was following the attack. Last month an Australian tourist survived after a lion jumped through the window of a car he was travelling in in Johannesburg and mauled him. Brendan Smith's legs were badly injured but he survived the attack. A circus worker is seen with the lion using a makeshift leash (left) and appearing to sit on the lion (right)\n",

            "A former footballer who fronted a £30million investment scheme and lived a millionaire's lifestyle is now 'surviving on handouts', a court has heard. Michael McIndoe, who played for Bristol City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, lured fellow footballers into the scheme with promises of a huge 20 per cent return. But the scheme collapsed amid mounting debts and the tricky winger was declared bankrupt in October last year with more than £2million debts. The footballer - who was known as 'Mr Big' in Marbella, where he partied with glamorous girls, is now being chased through the courts by creditors. McIndoe, circled smoking on a cigar, lived a millionaire's lifestyle but is now surviving on handouts . The former winger revelled in the glamorous lifestyle after persuading fellow players to sign up to the scheme . McIndoe celebrates scoring against Arsenal in December 2005 - it has now been revealed he has no income . Scots-born McIndoe dated a string of glamour models, including Helena Fletcher and Emma Frain (pictured) The 35-year-old told a hearing in London he was now surviving on the generosity of 'good friends and family'. He said: 'Since the bankruptcy, my girlfriend gave me some cash in July and I believe the trustee's solicitors are pressing for that money to be paid back. 'I have received some money from friends, around £9,000, and some money from NatWest for overcharging me on an account. 'But I have no income.' He added how he was not claiming Jobseekers' Allowance and said his legal representatives were working without fee. Questioned by barrister Mr Andrew Carruth, on behalf of the trustees of his bankrupt estate, he said he had not bet for two years and that reports of his previous gambling accounts topping £1 million were 'vastly over rated'. He said £1.5 million owed to one creditor had been invested into 'Stamp', the private members London nightclub he launched in 2011, but was later closed. McIndoe also denied selling a property in Edinburgh at a cheap rate as part of a panic selling reaction to his financial meltdown. McIndoe and his friends at the Ocean Club in Marbella where 'beds' can cost up to 7,950 euros (£5,790) A footballer taken in by the scheme alleges McIndoe had spent £40,000 on champagne in one day . The former winger played for Bristol City in the Championship final in 2008 - the 'Cider Army' lost to Hull City . It was revealed in January this year that up to 300 players signed up to the scheme that may be the biggest swindle ever to hit the British game. The scheme sucked in players including former Tottenham Hotspur forward Robbie Keane and ex-Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard, who is thought to have lost around £600,000 which led him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. Furious creditors are demanding answers to where there money has gone but McIndoe - who now lives with his mother in Edinburgh - said he had no property and his only bank account had been frozen. McIndoe used the promise of 20 per cent returns on people's money to fund his champagne lifestyle . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. At the height of his scheme, McIndoe revelled in a playboy's lifestyle, partying in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash. He hired huge villas in Marbella, where he drove a fleet of expensive cars such as a Bentley and a Maybach and hired celebrities, such as the X Factor winner Alexandra Burke to perform at lavish parties. Scots-born McIndoe also dated a string of glamour models, including Helena Fletcher and Emma Frain. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme. He ran lavish parties at clubs including Funky Buddha in London and ploughed money into private members' club Stamp on Oxford Street. The 35-year-old is also claimed to have rented a £4,000-a-week suite in London's five-star Mayfair Hotel. He also had in an apartment in Eaton Square, one of the UK's poshest addresses in the exclusive Belgravia district of the capital. But last year, the funds dried up and he was investigated. McIndoe told the court he had co-operated with the official receiver and had handed over documents ahead of a meeting with trustees next week. The bankruptcy hearing was adjourned till June 17.\n",

            "(CNN)A large storm system dubbed Typhoon Maysak is churning over the Pacific Ocean, days away from a possible direct hit on the Philippines. Maysak is moving west-northwest after skirting the Federated States of Micronesia, according to the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Its eye is projected to make landfall in the central or northern part of the Philippine island of Luzon on Sunday, though the country's residents could start feeling its effects days before. That could interrupt the Easter celebration for many in the predominantly Catholic nation, which may be socked by heavy rains and potent winds. The International Red Cross noted that \"many people are expected to throng coastal areas at this time.\" Images of the typhoon as seen from the International Space Station were posted to Twitter, including a Vine video showing the swirling eye of the storm. The storm has weakened and is expected to lose more strength before it reaches the Philippines. Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday were 150 mph, making it a super typhoon in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's definition. But by Thursday, the winds' strength had declined to around 132 mph -- no longer a super typhoon but still the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. \"This will not be a catastrophic storm,\" Cabrera said. That said, it could still cause flooding and bring strong winds, he cautioned. The Philippines is frequently hit by typhoons. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. But that devastation paled in comparison to the havoc wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people and injured more than 27,000 others. That typhoon, considered to be among the strongest storms ever to make landfall, hit the eastern city of Tacloban especially hard. The irony of the upcoming storm is its timing: in April, just after the Philippines Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration officially declared the onset of the nation's dry, or summer, season. PAGASA meteorologist Shelley Ignacio predicts Maysak -- which is called Chedeng in the Philippines -- will bring heavy rains to Luzon starting on Friday, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council went on red alert on Wednesday because of the storm, the news agency reports. That alert means all relevant personnel are on standby and the public should be on guard for possible effects of the storm. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.\n",

            "Gareth Bale drives an unstoppable left-footed bullet in at the far post during a routine training drill as Real Madrid train on Wednesday. It's powerful, poised and emphatic, though far from a winner at the Nou Camp, but it's all the Welshman can do for now as he returns from international duty to a less than appreciative fan base. Bale joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Co for their second day back at training as they prepared for their first match back after the devastating loss to Barcelona that saw them fall four points behind the La Liga leaders. Gareth Bale chests down a cross from the right before unleashing a bullet in Real Madrid training . Perfectly balanced, Bale cocks his powerful left leg to hit his shot on the half-volley . Having hit the ball sweetly it rockets into the net at the far post giving the keeper no chance . The under fire winger returns to Madrid on the back of a vital double for Wales against Israel as they claimed top spot in Euro 2016 qualifying's group B. Showing no signs of the drama he's been subject to in Spain, including an attack on his white Bentley by a so-called fan, Bale scored his 15th and 16th goals for his country. His first came from a curling free-kick over the wall before his second, a strong finish after arriving late into the area, marked his 20th for the season in all competitions. Bale evades Nacho Fernandez  during training session at Valdebebas training ground on Wednesday . Cristiano Ronaldo works up a sweat at training (left) left as Marcelo brings the ball down on his chest . Playmaker Luka Modric (left) keeps control as defensive midfielder Asier Illarramendi watches closely . Back from duty with Germany, Toni Kroos (right) comes up against Spaniard Illarramendi . Bale holds off Fernandez in a star-studded pack of players at Carlo Ancelotti's disposal . Goals aside, Bale was a menace throughout the match, constantly asking questions against the side that until this match led Wales and Belgium in the group. Carlo Ancelotti and his state employed small-sided games and shooting drills to bring Real back to business as usual on Wednesday as they prepare to take on 19th-placed Granada on Sunday in an early 11am kick-off. Real have won just one of their last five games in all competitions - and was a 2-0 home victory against Levante in which Bale, the player Real fans have seemingly fallen out of love with, scored both goals. James Rodriguez (left), who is continuing his recovery from injury, and Marcelo find cause for a fist pump . Rodriguez puts pressure on young prospect Martin Odegaard (right) ahead of their clash with Granada . Speaking on Spanish TV, Alvaro Arbeloa spoke out in defence of Bale saying the fans' treatment of the 25-year-old is inexpicable. 'They have it out for him. He's done a great job since he arrived at the club and I don't understand this witch hunt against him',' he said on Neox TV's El Chiringuito. The defender had similar words for Ronaldo, who has also faced hash criticism of late. 'They've been very unfair with him. Nobody can doubt his professionalism. He has every right to think they've been unfair to him. You cannot be as good as Cristiano unless you are very demanding with yourself, or the first player in training, or you look after yourself at home.'\n",

            "A couple who took their 14-year-old son out of school without permission for a five-day holiday to Spain were forced to pay a £1,230 fine after bailiffs were called in. They were originally fined £120 for the unauthorised absence from Sweyne Park School in Rayleigh, Essex, after being convicted in November 2014 of failing to ensure their child regularly attended school. After the unnamed family, of Hullbridge, Essex, appealed unsuccessfully against the fine and, after they did not pay, court bailiffs visited on March 6 demanding £1,230. A couple who took their 14-year-old son out of Sweyne Park School in Essex without permission for a five-day holiday to Spain were forced to pay a £1,230 fine after bailiffs were called in . The boy’s grandmother, from Benfleet, Essex, paid up to stop the bailiffs taking property to cover the amount owed. The grandmother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The bailiff informed me that if the eye-watering fine of £1,230 wasn’t paid immediately they would force entry.’ They told her goods would be sold to cover £3,500 for the fine and charges and the parents would be jailed for three months. She added:  'He's a bright boy, my grandson, and he could easily hack five days off. 'He had never been in an aeroplane and my daughter wanted him to have the experience.

            "An outraged food blogger who alleges Instagram fitness star Ashy Bines used her recipes in an e-book without crediting her or asking if she could publish them in a book said she was 'devastated' to find her work had been taken. Sydney personal trainer Allie Dodds, 24, regularly published recipes for her friends and family on her Mealspiration blog before she started her business, Sweets and Sweat, in September 2013. Her gourmet recipes caught the eye of Ms Bines, a Gold Coast businesswoman and successful personal trainer, in 2012. Ms Dodds said Ms Bines contacted her asking if she could share her recipes online with her Facebook fan base and she agreed. 'I thought, that was OK she's going to share a couple of my recipes, give me some credit and that was it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. But she said she was stunned when a colleague noticed her Salmon and Cauliflower Sushi recipe in a 2012 edition of Ms Bines' Clean Eating Recipe Book. Ashy Bines (pictured with a green smoothie) was the subject of appalling abuse after posting a video admitting recipes in her clean eating e-package had been plagiarised. She did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's questions after a blogger came forward suggesting she had also been plagiarised from on Tuesday . Ms Bines is a successful health coach and entrepreneur is best known for her 12 week Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge. Programs such as hers and Bikini Body Guide author Kayla Itsines have become increasingly popular . Personal trainer Allie Dodds (pictured) alleges her sushi and cauliflower recipe and others were placed in Ms Bines' book without permission. She runs the Instagram account The.Sweet.Sweat . 'I said \"can you show me?\" and it was my pictures and my recipe. 'I just couldn't believe it... That's really nasty. 'It was just Ashy's Guidelines and zero mention of my name or my blog and I was just like \"you're kidding me\". 'At first I was a little bit excited and then I was pretty devastated (not to be credited).' Ms Dodds said recipes inside the guide included her Kanga Rolls, Chicken Mince Quiche and others. She contacted Ms Bines in July 2013 to question her use of recipes and photos but never heard back. Ms Bines admitted in a video statement reported overnight that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen. She said it happened because she 'outsourced' the recipe component to an unnamed nutritionist.' Ms Bines did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's questions over whether she was referring to Ms Dodd's recipes. A spokeswoman said she was 'in meetings all day'. In her video message earlier this week, Ms Bines said: 'By outsourcing this to a nutritionist I was trying to give you all something of value and to come up with delicious recipes from the food I suggested. 'Unfortunately I may have been too naïve to think that I wouldn't have check the origins of each recipe instead trusting that the work would be completed in an honest and professional manner. The 26-year-old (left) has earned an enormous social media, with almost one million followers on social media . Allie's blog: This recipe appeared on Ms Dodds' blog, Mealspiration, in 2012 . Ashy's book: This recipe appeared in an edition of Ashy Bines' Clean Eating Recipe Book . Access to the latest edition of Ms Bines' Clean Eating Diet Plan currently costs $USD75.90 (or around $100AUD) 'It's recently come to my attention that some of these recipes were not originals at all and have been copied from other sources. 'This was never my intention and it really sucks that these things can happen.' Ms Dodds said: 'Ashy's business is meant to be built around encouraging and empowering women however I am disappointed that I never received recognition from her. In text messages to the Gold Coast Bulletin on Monday, Ms Bines - who is pregnant - said she had received sickening online abuse producing the plagiarism video. Examples of the comments included 'I hope (your baby) gets down syndrome, you dirty liar' and 'you are a bitch, I pray a truck runs you over'. Ms Bines expressed disbelief at the comment involving her unborn child. 'To wish a baby gets Down syndrome gosh I actually didn't think you could sink any lower [sic],' she wrote on her social media account in response to the woman's comment. A supporter jumped in to also defend Ms Bines. 'Hate someone so much that you go out of your way to stalk them and wish an intentional disability on someone's baby?' the supporter said. 'When you grow up and mature and someone wishes that your baby is still born because they would hate to see such a tragic soul bring a poor bub into your world, let us know how it feels. 'Given that you think downs [sic] is so bad, it is people like you that the world does not need.' 'This was never my intention and it really sucks that these things can happen' Ms Bines said in a video message about plagiarism in her book.

            "One very good player moves out and another very good player moves in. Atletico Madrid supporters have stopped fretting about departures because they have good reason to be confident in the people that run the club and their ability to find adequate replacements. In goal Sergio Asenjo became David De Gea, became Thibaut Courtois, who looks to have become Jan Oblak. Playmaker Diego Ribas became Arda Turan. While centre-forward Diego Forlan became Sergio Aguero, became Radamel Falcao, became Diego Costa who has now become that bloodied battering-ram Mario Mandzukic. Atletico Madrid know how to replace stars, from David De Gea (left to right), to Thibaut Courtois, to Jan Oblak . Sergio Aguero (left) was a star at Atletico before being replaced by Radamel Falcao at the Spanish club . Diego Costa (left, squaring up to John Terry) was sold to Chelsea but replaced by Mario Mandzukic (right) Atletico manager Diego Simeone has been pulling the strings at the La Liga club in terms of transfers . The secret of their success is often exactly that – a secret. No club has used the third-party ownership lenience in Spain more to its advantage than Atletico Madrid. Transfers like Radamel Falcao were always shrouded in mystery. How were they able to sell Aguero to Manchester City and hand over a large portion of the fee to the tax man to service their monumental overdraft with the state, and yet still go into the transfer market and get Falcao for an even higher price than Aguero? Jorge Mendes has worked closely with the club and with its managing director Miguel angel Gil Marin across the last five years and there is no question the club have benefited from a healthy relationship with the world’s most prolific agent. It was bordering on comical in 2010 when the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai picked Gil as its sports director of the year. Mendes played a large part in the setting up of the annual awards – he himself has won agent of the year every year since its inauguration. Atletico playmaker Diego Ribas became Arda Turan at the Vicente Calderon under Simeone . Falcao (right), formerly of Atletico, sits with super-agent Jorge Mendes (left) during a match in France . Atletico's CEO Miguel Angel Gil Marin (far right) give a press conference in Madrid in 2009 . His domination of the best agent award was easier to justify than Gil’s prize that year, coming as it did when Atletico were still hugely indebted to Spain’s Inland Revenue and forced to fire sell every summer. But Gil has led Atletico out of trouble. He has picked his agent friends well, worked the loophole in the system – one Fifa want to close allowing third party ownership in Spain when it is banned in other leagues - and that has played a part in the club's rise. Mendes it was who discovered Costa and brought him to Atletico Madrid via Portugal. The super-agent can also claim to have been the man who saw the huge potential in the unrefined Brazilian front man, overruling scouts that he usually trusted without question and signing the youngster from Lagarto thus beginning the process of making him one of Europe’s top striker. He was loaned him out to four La Liga clubs but was always brought back to Atletico who would eventually win the Spanish Cup, the European Super Cup and the League with him as their centre-forward. Koke is Atletico's brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday night . Mario Suarez and Gabi try to stop Cristiano Ronaldo during the Madrid derby in the Champions League . As well as using the right agents to get the right players Atletico have – like so many teams in Spain benefitted from an extensive and well-run youth system. Koke is their brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday against Real Madrid with Mario Suarez and Gabi who also both came through the ranks at Atletico albeit only arriving at the first team after long spells away from the club. Next season Oliver Torres should return from a hugely successful spell at Porto and line up alongside another off the conveyor build: the hugely impressive Saul Niguez. It also shouldn’t be forgotten that with a very similar squad back in 2012 Atletico Madrid were closer to the relegation places than the European places and even their most blinkered fan would have dismissed out of hand the idea that they would ever be winning the league and playing the Champions League final in the same season any time soon. The reason for the change is perhaps their greatest signing of all – Diego Simeone. He arrived at the start of 2012 just after they had been knocked out of Copa del Rey by a third division side. The likes of former Osasuna winger Juanfran were in the team back then too – he looked a symbol of the oh-so average signings being made by the club at the time. Simeone has been up there with their greatest signings when they made him manager previously . Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now in the form of his life at Atletico . Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now first choice on the right hand side of Spain’s defence. His transformation is still a symbol, only now it is one of just how much the club and team have progressed. Chinese company Wanda now owns 20 per cent of Atletico Madrid, their tax debt is under control and they are in a position to sign players without having to sell. Having bought so well when they were in a worse financial situation, supporters are optimistic – just as long as they don’t lose Simeone: the real alchemist at Atletico Madrid.\n",

            "Tripoli, Libya (CNN)Smugglers lure Arab and African migrants by offering discounts to get onto overcrowded ships if people bring more potential passengers, a CNN investigation has revealed. A smuggler in the Libyan capital of Tripoli laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees, during a conversation that a CNN producer secretly filmed. The conversation, recorded using a mobile phone, exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships. An estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, but still more wait to try to reach Europe. CNN's producer was introduced to a Senegalese and Malian smuggler by an intermediary in Tripoli, who mistakenly thought she was a Syrian looking to bring other Syrian refugees with her onto boats to Italy. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories . The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of Tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash-littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the \"final price\" for Syrians -- often thought to be richer than their African migrant counterparts -- was $1,000. He added that for each Syrian she brought with her, the producer would get a $100 discount. So if she brought 10, she could travel free. He explained how the \"discount\" was \"well known,\" suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat. Any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors, and that the Senegalese pilot would have a satellite telephone and GPS to assist the crossing. He also assured CNN's producer, when asked, that if the people became too many, they would use two boats. Pregnant women among migrants trying to cross .\n",

            "Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was found guilty on Wednesday of first-degree murder in a deadly late-night shooting, sealing the downfall of an athlete who once had a $40million contract and a standout career ahead of him. Hernandez, 25, looked to his right and pursed his lips after the jury forewoman read the verdict. The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole in the slaying of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old landscaper and amateur weekend football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee. Hernandez’s mother, Terri, and his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, cried and gasped when they heard the verdict. Shayanna Jenkins wept on his mother’s shoulder. Hernandez later mouthed to them: 'Be strong. Be strong.' Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been found guilty on of first-degree murder . The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole . The conviction sealed the downfall of an athlete who once had a $40million contract and a standout career . The former football pro was also found guilty on firearm and ammunition charges. For reasons that were never made clear to the jury, Lloyd was shot six times in the middle of the night on June 17, 2013, in a deserted industrial park near Hernandez’s home. Police almost immediately zeroed in on Hernandez because they found in Lloyd’s pocket the key to a car the NFL player had rented. Within hours of Hernandez’s arrest, the Patriots cut the former Pro Bowl athlete, who was considered one of the top tight ends in the game. Prosecutors presented a wealth of evidence that Hernandez was with Lloyd at the time he was killed, including home security video from Hernandez’s mansion, witness testimony and cellphone records that tracked Lloyd’s movements. Hernandez’s lawyer, James Sultan, acknowledged for the first time during closing arguments that Hernandez was there when Lloyd was killed. Terri Hernandez clutches her son's fianceé Shayanna as the jury returned a guilty on all counts . Ursula Ward, mother of the victim, reacts to the guilty verdict for former NFL player  Hernandez . Hernandez was pictured posing with a Glock handgun when he was a student in 2009 . Odin Lloyd has been identified as the man who was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Hernandez . But the attorney pinned the shooting on two of Hernandez’s friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, saying his client was a '23-year-old kid' who witnessed a shocking crime and didn’t know what to do. Wallace and Ortiz will stand trial later. Prosecutors have suggested Lloyd may have been killed because he knew too much about Hernandez’s alleged involvement in a deadly 2012 drive-by shooting in Boston. But they were not allowed to tell the jury that because the judge said it was speculation. As a result, they never offered a motive beyond saying Hernandez appeared angry with Lloyd at a nightclub two nights before the killing. Hernandez faces further legal trouble: He is awaiting trial on murder charges in the drive-by shooting. He is accused of gunning down two men over a spilled drink at a nightclub. In the Lloyd killing, the defense argued that investigators fixated on Hernandez because of his celebrity and conducted a shoddy investigation in their zeal to confirm their suspicions. A court officer places handcuffs on the wrists Hernandez after the guilty verdict was read during . Shaneah Jenkins, left, girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd, comforts a cousin of Lloyd in the courtroom . THE EVIDENCE . Prosecutors produced neither a murder weapon nor a witness to Lloyd's shooting in a North Attleborough industrial park. Their case hinged on other elements: cellphone records showing Hernandez and two friends communicating with Lloyd around the time of the slaying; Lloyd's phone pinging cell towers between Boston and North Attleborough; surveillance video at Hernandez's home showing him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun minutes after workers at the industrial park heard gunshots; a joint found near Lloyd's body with Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it. THE DEFENSE . During closing arguments, Hernandez lawyer James Sultan for the first time acknowledged what evidence pointed to: Hernandez was there when Lloyd was killed. But he described Hernandez as a witness, a 23-year-old kid who didn't know what to do after seeing a shocking crime. Sultan pinned it on Hernandez's two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, both of whom have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later. JURY'S ROAD TRIP . Midway through the trial, jurors boarded a bus to tour key spots in the case, including Hernandez's home, the street where the victim lived and the spot where his body was found. State police stood guard as the jury inspected the street in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood where Lloyd lived with his mother and sisters. Jurors also trekked out in the cold to the snow-covered gravel lot where Lloyd's bullet-ridden body was found and toured Hernandez's mansion a mile from the crime scene. TEARS FOR A SON . Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, wept quietly at times during the trial. Overcome with emotion, she would sometimes leave the courtroom in tears when jurors were shown graphic photos of her 27-year-old son's body. Before Ward testified, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ordered her not to cry on the stand. Ward remained stoic. When photos of Lloyd's body in the morgue were shown, she mouthed the words, 'My baby, my baby.' HERNANDEZ'S FIANCEE . Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, was compelled to testify after she was granted immunity from prosecution. Wearing her large diamond engagement ring, Jenkins testified that Hernandez had told her in the days following the shooting that he was not involved. Jenkins testified she removed a box from their basement at his request the day after the slaying but never looked inside before she dumped it in a random trash bin. Prosecutors said the box may have held evidence including the murder weapon. Jenkins, who has a 2-year-old daughter with Hernandez, avoided looking at him during her testimony. THE SISTERS . Jenkins and her younger sister, Shaneah, both attended the trial at times but sat on opposite sides of the courtroom. Shayanna sat behind Hernandez and could be seen joking with him, several times exchanging whispered 'I love yous' when she attended. Shaneah would sit with Lloyd's family. Before he was killed, she and Lloyd had made plans to move in together while she attended law school in Boston. Both sisters testified while the other sat in the audience, watching and sometimes seeming annoyed. THE VERDICT . After Wednesday's verdict was read, Jenkins and Hernandez's mother clutched each other and cried. Hernandez mouthed to them the words, 'Be strong. Be strong.' The verdict came early on the seventh day of jury deliberations. He was automatically sentenced to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors said Hernandez organized the killing, summoned his two friends to help carry it out, and drove Lloyd and the others to the secluded spot in the industrial park. During closing arguments, prosecutors also accused Hernandez of pulling the trigger, though under the law it was not necessary to prove who fired the shots to convict him. Security video from inside Hernandez’s home showed him holding what appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd was killed. The surveillance system also captured Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz relaxing at his home hours after Lloyd was shot, hanging out in the basement “man cave,” lounging by the pool and cuddling Hernandez’s baby daughter. Hernandez was an All-American out of the University of Florida who was drafted by the Patriots in the fourth round in 2010. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

            "Usually a highlight of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, Alex Perry's name is a notable absence from the schedule in 2015. The designer revealed in February that he would not be presenting a collection at the Sydney event this week, and revealed to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday that he was enjoying 'taking a breather'. Despite this year marking the 20th anniversary of MBFWA, Perry is taking in the fashions from the comfort of the front row, after focusing on his international efforts of late. 'My team and I just need a bit of a breather - we've just finished selling in Paris, and we've had an incredible season over there, so we're busy focusing on international at the moment,' Perry told DMA at the Ellery show on first night of Fashion Week. Scroll down for video . Perry pulls out of presenting: Acclaimed designer Alex Perry opts out of showing at this year's MBFWA . 'We're busy working on Cruise too,' (Perry's popular party dress collection). 'I wouldn’t be standing here talking to you if we were showing on Monday or Tuesday,' he laughs. This is only the second Fashion Week the design powerhouse has missed in two decades. When asked if he will miss the excitement of running his own show, Perry said while he loves it, he's happy to sit back and see it from a new perspective. 'The chances I do get, I love to take in the whole thing, my eyes will be wide open as I sit in the front row,' he says. 'Because I'm not presenting a show I can really look forward to supporting some of my friends like Kym (Ellery) and Johnny (Schembri from By Johnny) they're my two faves  I'm specifically wanting to see.' Fashion favourite: Perry says Kym Ellery (pictured left) is one of his favourite designers showing this week . On Kym Ellery's show, Perry says she had a great cast of models and knew the fashion would be beautiful and all about showcasing shape and new directions. As for what he sees trending this season, Perry said the Australian market is so diverse, anything could happen. 'There are so many different designers with so many styles now, It’s not like it was 50 years ago when skirts are to the knee or something like that, there are so many handwritings, so I think it will all become really apparent after we see them this week.' 'Someone like Kym is so incredibly on point internationally at the moment which is her style, but then Johnny is going to give us some fun, sexy tight stuff.' Fashion flashback: Showing since 1996 , this marks the second time in twenty years Perry won't show . Model moment: Perry with Cheyenne Tozzi (pictured left) who previously starred in Australia's Next Top Model . Perry also believes the Australian market has it's on unique flair, different to fashion internationally that has a more uniform look. 'We definitely have our own signature. I wouldn't say relaxed even though people say that all the time, it’s more we have a different take on fashion. There's a mix of designers that are increadibly accomplished then there are younger designers who take more risks and challenges,' he says. 'And at the same time you can Australian designers anywhere in the world and it stands up in any country you go to and people are intrigued by it when they see girls wearing it.' Taking a break from the runway, Perry now is devoting his time to international enterprises, with a specific focus on the Asian and Middle Eastern market. Front row fashionistas: Perry  front row alongside Marie Claire's Jackie Frank (left) and Kyly Clarke (right) 'Asia is a big expansion market and the Middle East is huge, it’s had unprecedented growth in so while I’m doing stuff in Australia I’m also doing things that resonate in those regions to build brand profile in those countries.' For Perry who also is a judge on Australia's Next Top Model, this also will include more work in TV overseas. He has currently filmed production for Asia’s Next Top Model which is said to broadcast to over 11 million homes in Asia and Middle East via the Star World Network and he's also looking into more TV opportunities there but can't go into the specifics yet. Model Mogul: Perry  with Alessandra Ambrosio (left) who guest stars in this year's Australia's Next Top Model . From A-List to Asia: Perry has just filmed Asia's Next Top Model and plans to work on more TV projects in Asia . As for his fashion empire, Perry believes despite his work in TV, as well as linen and Specsaver lines, fashion is his first and foremost love and while he admits he won't stop at one thing, everything has to have synergy with his fashion brand. 'TV stuff gets a lot of press, but in reality  I’m a fashion designer  and it’s all about the credibility of clothes, so I’m really focused on that because that propels everything else.'\n",

            "Nasa has finalised an ambitious mission to send a spacecraft closer to the sun than ever before. The Solar Probe Plus will carry four experiments into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star . During the closest passes around the sun, temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Scroll down for video . Solar Probe Plus will carry four instrument suites into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star. The launch window opens for 20 days starting on July 31, 2018. Over 24 orbits, the mission will use seven flybys of Venus to reduce its distance from the sun. The closest three will be just 3.8 million miles from the surface of the star. Solar Probe Plus is scheduled to launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta 4-Heavy rocket with an upper stage from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The launch window opens for 20 days starting on July 31, 2018. Over 24 orbits, the mission will use seven flybys of Venus to reduce its distance from the sun. The closest three will be just 3.8 million miles from the surface of the star. Scientists have long wanted to send a probe through the sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona, to better understand the solar wind and the material it carries into our solar system. The primary science goals for the Solar Probe Plus mission are to trace the flow of energy and understand the heating of the solar corona and to explore the physical mechanisms that accelerate the solar wind and energetic particles. To meet those objectives, Solar Probe Plus will carry four instrument suites into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star. These instruments will study magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles, and will image the solar wind. The spacecraft and instruments will be protected from the sun’s heat by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield. During the closest passes around the sun, temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. How it will get there: Over 24 orbits, the mission will use seven flybys of Venus to reduce its distance from the sun. The small car-sized spacecraft will plunge directly into the sun's atmosphere approximately four million miles from our star's surface. It will explore a region no other spacecraft ever has encountered. The mission - which will fly closer to the sun than any spacecraft has before - reached a major milestone last month when it successfully completed its Critical Design Review, or CDR. An independent NASA review board met at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, or APL, in Laurel, Maryland, March 16-20, 2015, to review all aspects of the mission plan. APL has designed and will build and operate the spacecraft for NASA. The CDR certifies that the Solar Probe Plus mission design is at an advanced stage and that fabrication, assembly, integration and testing of the many elements of the mission may proceed. Solar Probe Plus will carry four instrument suites into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star. These instruments will study magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles, and will image the solar wind. Wide-field Imager: principal investigator, Russell Howard, Naval Research Laboratory in Washington. This telescope will make 3-D images of the sun's corona, or atmosphere. The experiment will also provide 3-D images of the solar wind and shocks as they approach and pass the spacecraft. This investigation complements instruments on the spacecraft providing direct measurements by imaging the plasma the other instruments sample. Fields Experiment: principal investigator, Stuart Bale, University of California Space Sciences Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif. This investigation will make direct measurements of electric and magnetic fields, radio emissions, and shock waves that course through the sun's atmospheric plasma. The experiment also serves as a giant dust detector, registering voltage signatures when specks of space dust hit the spacecraft's antenna. Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun: principal investigator, David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. This investigation consists of two instruments that will monitor electrons, protons and ions that are accelerated to high energies in the sun's atmosphere. Heliospheric Origins with Solar Probe Plus: principal investigator, Marco Velli of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Velli is the mission's observatory scientist, responsible for serving as a senior scientist on the science working group. He will provide an independent assessment of scientific performance and act as a community advocate for the mission.\n",

            "Conrad Clitheroe, left, and Gary Cooper, right, were thrown in jail after being arrested for writing down aircraft registration numbers in Dubai . Three British planespotters who have spent two months in prison in the United Arab Emirates after they were arrested on national security grounds have been released. Conrad Clitheroe, 54 and Gary Cooper, 45, from Stockport, along with their ex-pat friend Neil Munro were stopped by police for writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport. They were taken to a police station and, despite being told they would not be detained, were put into prison. Clitheroe's wife Valerie had written to British Prime Minister David Cameron to ask him to intervene in the case, raising concerns about her husband's health due to his heart murmur and high blood pressure. They were finally told earlier this week that they could return home after charges of espionage would not be brought against them. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the release of three British nationals detained in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates on February 21. 'We are providing consular assistance.' Attorney Nasser Hashem previously said the men would be free to go after the court accepted a defense argument that they were pursuing their passion for plane spotting and had no ill intent. Mr Clitheroe will now be able to return home to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with his wife  on May 9. Speaking earlier this week, Mrs Clitheroe said: 'I am absolutely ecstatic. Apart from our wedding and the birth of my children this is the best day of my life. 'I just can't wait to see him, to hug him, to hold him. 'We got a call from the lawyer to tell us he'd been in court and the case had been dropped. 'We then confirmed it with the consulate. 'I am just so happy, we've been ringing everyone to let them now. I'm in a bit of shock too, I don't feel like it can be real. 'How can you hold someone for that long with no charges? I don't understand it but I'm so so glad.' Earlier this month, Mrs Clitheroe had raised concerns because her husband had run out of blood pressure medication. Valerie Clitheroe (pictured with her husband) said both he and Mr Cooper had been keen plane spotters since boyhood and pleaded for their release . The men had travelled to Dubai for a four-day holiday on February 18. All three friends were keen to see Fujairah Airport, which is used by older and rarer aircraft. They drove the 70-mile journey there on February 21, but were stopped by an off-duty policeman after they slowed down to note the registration numbers of planes. Mr Clitheroe has always insisted they never took any photographs. Although plane spotting is not illegal in the United Arab Emirates, it is not understood and is frowned upon. The men were taken to a police station, where they were allegedly told they could only leave if they signed a form in Arabic saying they would not practise their hobby there again. But after signing the document, without asking for a translation, they were kept in custody overnight. They were brought before a prosecutor the next day and then moved to Fujairah Prison. Mr Clitheroe posted this picture on February 19 as he pursued his hobby at the Sheraton Deira Hotel in Dubai . Their case was escalated to a matter of 'national security'. Sharing a cell with over 20 others, eating on the floor and forced to stare at the four walls for most of the day, the families were concerned about their welfare - particularly as Mr Clitheroe needs medication for his heart condition. A judge last month extended their custody licence, which was up again on April 12, but an admin error delayed the hearing until this week. Mrs Clitheroe added: 'Conrad was beginning to think the worse and that they would never be released. 'Things had seemed to be so against them from the start that they thought it was going to end badly. The men were held after being seen by police writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport . 'We thought they would be charged with something and fined so it's come as a shock that there are no charges at all. We had started planning to go out there to deal with the lawyers face to face.' Mrs Clitheroe said the men had been keen plane spotters since they were children. The families of Mr Clitheroe and Mr Cooper were helped by charity 'Detained in Dubai' to pay £9,000 for a lawyer to fight their case. A crowd-funding site set up by the men's work colleagues has raised more than £5,000. Earlier this week, Radha Stirling, the founder of Detained in Dubai said charges of espionage against the trio had finally been dropped at the Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. 'The charges are being dropped with no fines or penalties. They've had a long time to wait to be told your case is ridiculous,' said Ms Stirling.\n",

            "A simple breath test that could help detect the early stages of stomach cancer has been developed by scientists. The screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development. By looking for distinctive ‘breath prints’, researchers were also able to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease. Scroll down for video . In and out: Thanks to a breath test, researchers claim there were able to detect the early stages of stomach cancer and also to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease (stock image) Israeli researchers say the system is accurate, cheap – and allows patients to be monitored without using invasive procedures. The discovery comes as scientists in the US made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours. The breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. About 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the UK each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed. Research leader Professor Hossam Haick of the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Haifa, said: ‘The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, insensitivity to confounding factors, and potentially low cost.’ Breathe: The tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development (stock image) Previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer, but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes. In the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer. They were analysed by so-called nanomaterial sensors, which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient’s breath. The test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. The researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies, an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube. A large trial involving thousands of patients, including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes, is currently under way in Europe to test the technology’s suitability as a screening method, they add. Meanwhile, US experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease. The findings, published in the scientific journal Oncogene, raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset. The results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers – and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous. Professor Renny Franceschi, of the University of Michigan, said it paves the way for a ‘warning light’ that signals how dangerous the cancer is. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present. But they are unreliable, holding a high risk of ‘false positives’ that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer. Professor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.\n",

            "Archaeologists  have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000-year-old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of Boudicca's rebels - as the London Crossrail excavations continue. The latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic River Walbrook, in London, has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony. When about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a Roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise. Scroll down for video . New find: Around seven human skulls (pictured) dating back nearly 2,000 years have so far been found as part of the latest discovery by archaeologists at the London Crossrail site near Liverpool Street station . Roman rummaging: One of the skulls (left) was uncovered next to a Roman road which has also been found. A piece of Roman figurative pottery (right) was also dug up during searches of the site . Digging for history: A cross-section of the Roman roadside ditch uncovered at Liverpool Street station . The estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be Boudicca's rebels. Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of  executed criminals and rebels. A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories. He said: 'We don't have any answers yet but we are looking into it.' The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. A spoon from the Tudor period (left) was unearthed from a deep ditch, along with leather fragments (right) A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories for the latest finds, which included cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot . 'No answers': Archaeologists have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000-year-old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of Boudicca's rebels. The bones are to be sent away for further analysis . A long needle believed to be from the Roman period was also dug up. It will now undergo scientific tests . Revolt: Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who tried to defeat the Roman army . The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. Her husband, Prasutagus, was ruler of the Iceni people, and the Romans allowed Prasutagus to continue as king, ruling on their behalf. But, when Prasutagus died, the Romans decided to rule the Iceni directly and they confiscated the property of the leading Iceni families. The Romans are also said to have stripped and whipped Boudicca, and raped her daughters. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. Colchester was the first target of the Boudiccan army and many of the townspeople were rounded up and sacrificed in nearby groves. The Crossrail team spokesman said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls from 2,000 years ago and Boudicca's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out. Work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network, has now been completed. It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be, in archaeological terms, London's most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site. Among the skeletons discovered at the burial site - used from 1569 until at least 1738, including the Great Plague in 1665 - were a mother a her child buried side-by-side. They have now been transferred to the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA). It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the 3,000 skeletons previously found in the Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station . Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of executed criminals and rebels .

A close-up look of the Roman needle found as part of the archaeological digs . A decoration thought to be from the Tudor period was among the historic finds near Liverpool Street station . Crossrail workers are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - which was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow. It was used to bury London’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as patients from Bethlem Royal Hospital - the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe. Workers are now digging through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains including a road that runs under the site. Archaeologists are expected to finish on site in September, after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall. Speaking last month, Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners. One of the human skulls unearthed as part of the London Crossrail archaeology project . The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives . New find: The Crossrail team said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls and Boudicca's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out. The skeleton above was found at an earlier date . Careful work: The excavation of 3,000 skeletons (pictured) from Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network, has now been completed . Crossrail workers are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - which was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow . 'The Bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of London's history, including the transition from the Tudor-period city into cosmopolitan early-modern London. 'This is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in London. 'Bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city.' The Museum of London Archaeology is undertaking the archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street  on behalf of Crossrail. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners. So far, Crossrail has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. It is the UK's largest archaeology project. In 2013 and 2014, preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street site in 2013 and 2014  uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts. The Crossrail project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries, including more than 10,000 artefacts at more than 40 construction sites. In 2013, workers made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' in tunnels underneath Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls which were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. The Crossrail team unearthed Roman skulls in 2013, which had been buried in clusters at Bedlam . Working under the direction of archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls, as well as a collection of ancient Roman pottery. For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century. Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. Prior to the discovery of the Roman skulls, workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the Eldon Street area. These skeletons were found in August 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year .\n",

            "Together they wrote a string of chart-topping hits for some of the world's biggest stars and created the memorable theme tune of Australian television soap Neighbours. Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, who were married for more than three decades, were dubbed 'Mr and Mrs Music' after composing for artists including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Scott Walker, Shirley Bassey and Petula Clark. So when Trent died last month aged 74 after a long battle with cancer, Hatch was expected to be at her funeral to say a final goodbye. True, their marriage had ended in divorce, but they had a daughter together and one of the most successful creative unions in showbusiness. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Hatch was banned from the funeral by Trent's second husband, Colin Gregory, who today accuses the composer of breaking his wife's heart. Scroll down for video . Tony Hatch (left) and his former wife Jackie Trent (right) wrote a chart-topping hits for the world's biggest stars but he was banned from her funeral last month . He says that not only did she never forgive Hatch for the infidelity that ended their marriage, but she believed to her dying day that he had denied her the credit she was due for some of their compositions. Although they were responsible for about 400 songs together, they had been mired in a long-running feud over seven that Trent claimed she co-wrote. After years of pressure, says Gregory, Hatch agreed to acknowledge Trent's part and her name now appears against some of the songs on the Tony Hatch website. But on other songs, Hatch is the only composer credited. Gregory told The Mail on Sunday: 'Yes, I banned Hatch from attending Jackie's cremation.' The 71-year-old former policeman, who married Trent in 2005, said: 'It might seem petty and churlish of me because, whatever anybody says, Hatch and Trent are welded at the hip for all the wonderful work they did together. 'I would never contest that. Jackie never contested that. But her firm words to me were, \"I hate him for what he did to me and for what he's still doing to me.\" 'I couldn't and wouldn't contact Tony Hatch myself. It would be inappropriate because we're in litigation.' Instead, he passed the message to Trent's son from her first marriage, Darren, who Hatch had adopted when they married. Gregory said: 'Darren rang, giving it the smooth patter of, \"Oh, they had such a lovely warm life together\", which they did not. And when he said he wanted to invite Hatch to the cremation, I said quite firmly, \"No. If he turns up, I shall call the police.\" 'Suffice it to say that Jackie would not want Tony Hatch anywhere near her final moments on this earth. He and his wife were specifically banned from attending her funeral, or anything in connection with it. 'Jackie always told me, \"No service – just you.\"' The cremation was held on the Spanish island of Menorca, where Trent lived with Gregory. It is also home to Hatch and his wife. Hatch, 75, clearly got the message, writing on his Facebook page on the day of the funeral: 'Today was final departure day for her soul but I was BANNED by her husband Colin Gregory from attending the crematorium.' Gregory now plans to bring Trent's ashes home to Britain for a memorial service in May at her local parish church in Chesterton, Staffordshire. Much of Trent's wealth, he said, had recently been eroded – not least by the legal battle with her former husband over the songs, which Gregory claimed has cost about £20,000. It's a far cry from 1965 when Hatch and Trent met and fell in love. Hatch was already married and the couple embarked on an affair before marrying the next year and going on to become one of the most successful teams in music, earning millions of pounds. But if Hatch, the son of a pianist, who grew up in Pinner, North West London, and Trent, the daughter of a miner from Newcastle-under-Lyme, made a fortune, they seemed to have trouble holding on to it. The couple moved to Ireland at one point because of its tax benefits for artists. Hatch wrote the theme tune to Crossroads and is still remembered by many as the 'Mr Nasty' judge on 1970s TV talent show New Faces. In 1982, the pair moved to Australia and were later asked to write the theme song for Neighbours. Their marriage ended abruptly and abrasively back in Britain at Trent's 55th birthday party in 1995, when Hatch confessed that for years he had been in love with one of his wife's friends. Trent was devastated. Gregory plans to persevere with Trent's legal battle over the disputed songs: 'not for financial gain – Jackie was getting her share [of songwriting royalties] – but because it was her dying wish that he finally admitted she co-wrote those songs.' Hatch declined to comment.\n",

            "A bakery in Oregon has been told to pay $135,000 to a lesbian couple that it refused to make a wedding cake for two years ago. An administrative law judge said that Sweet Cakes by Melissa, in the Portland suburb of Gresham, discriminated against Rachel Bowman-Cryer and her wife Laurel and caused them emotional suffering. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron refused to make the couple, who held a commitment ceremony in June 2013, a cake after learning that they were lesbians in January of that year because they disapprove of gay marriage for religious reasons. The Kleins were able to raise more than $100,000 from anonymous donors on a fundraising page before it was shut down for violating GoFundMe's terms of service. Melissa Klein (behind counter) of Sweet Cakes by Melissa faces a $135,000 fine after being found guilty of discriminating against a lesbian couple when she and her husband refused to make them a wedding cake . Rachel Bowman-Cryer (right) and her wife Laurel (left) file a civil rights lawsuit and said that they had suffered emotional distress because of the case after they received death threats . The judge's Friday verdict comes after the Bowman-Cryers filed a civil rights suit in the case, which has joined a series of similar proceedings in a national debate about anti-LGBT discrimination and religious freedom. They said during compensation hearings that they had received death threats and were worried about losing their two foster children after the case received widespread attention, according to Oregon Live. Oregon prohibits businesses from discriminating based on sexual orientation and the Christian bakers are were found guilty of discrimination earlier this year. The bakery must pay up to $150,000, and the judge's Friday decision of $135,000 will be approved or amended by State Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. A ruling issued by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries saying that the Kleins discriminated also rejected their argument that she did not discriminate against the couple because she had previously sold Rachel Cryer a cake for her mother's wedding. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron (right), who closed their bakery in 2013 amid attention to the discrimination case, say they are in dire financial straits because of the fine . An administrative law court in Oregon ruled earlier this year against the Klein's defense that their constitutional right to expression of their religious beliefs superseded Oregon state law against discrimination . The Kleins, who closed their store in 2013 amid attention drawn to the discrimination and now operate it from their home, have said that they and their five children are struggling financially. 'This is real money that Aaron and Melissa are going to have to pay that otherwise would be used to pay their mortgage and feed their kids,' their lawyer Anna Harmon told the Oregonian. The bakery's Facebook page posted a message Friday saying that the fine 'will financially ruin us'. A GoFundMe page for the family has already raised $101,000 as of Friday night. The page, which has set its goal at $200,000, says that any excess funds will be given to 'will be used to cover those same expenses for others who defend their constitutional right to live consistently with their faith.' However, the fundraising site later shut down the couple's page for violating the company's terms of service. 'The subjects of the \"Support Sweet Cakes By Melissa\" campaign have been formally charged by local authorities and found to be in violation of Oregon state law concerning discriminatory acts. Accordingly, the campaign has been disabled,' the site told Go Local PDX. The Klein's said that 'Satan's really at work' after 'he administrators of gofundme because they claimed it was raising money for an illegal purpose'. The family will still receive the $100,000 they raised, though it is now urging potential donors to give them money on a fundraising site run by Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham. A lawyer for the Bowman-Cryers said Friday about the $135,000 amount that 'This is a proposed order and we view this matter as continuing to be active litigation', refusing to comment further. The case follows similar incidents in Colorado, where a Christian baker who refused to bake a wedding reception cake for a gay couple was found to have discriminated against them in 2013. The Bowman-Cryers said they were worried about losing their foster children, who they have since adopted, after attention was brought to their marriage. Oregon began allowing same sex marriage in May 2014 . A GoFundMe page for the bakery started Friday afternoon raised more than $100,000 in eight hours for the Klein's legal expenses . Another baker in the state who refused to bake cakes with Bible quotes and anti-gay messages was found not to have discriminated the Christian customer earlier this year. Indiana passed a law that many saw as allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT people earlier this year, though it has since amended it to say that discrimination is not allowed. A pizza parlor in the state that said it would deny service to gay couples raised more than $840,000 from donors online after it closed following backlash on social media for its decision. A CNN poll taken last week found that 57 per cent of Americans think that wedding-related businesses such as cake bakers should not be allowed to deny service to same sex couples. Oregon has allowed gay marriage since 2014, when its ban was struck down by a federal court for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Bownman-Cryers married in May that year, shortly after the judge's decision, according to the Statesman Journal. They have since adopted their foster children, two daughters aged eight and six. The state's law on discrimination against gay people makes exceptions for religious institutions such as schools and churches.\n",

            "A hard-hitting Scientology documentary slammed by John Travolta is unlikely to be aired in the UK because of fears that the broadcaster could be exposed to libel claims. Lawyers have warned that the differences in defamation law in Northern Ireland mean controversial US expose HBO's 'Going Clear' might not be broadcast by Sky Atlantic. The Alex Gibney-directed film, which alleges abusive practices at the religion's US headquarters, was due to premiere in the UK earlier this month to coincide with its American release. But the fact that Northern Ireland is not subject to the 2013 Defamation Act means Sky is set to postpone or cancel the show entirely, according to the Observer. Scroll down for video . A hard-hitting Scientology documentary slammed by John Travolta (pictured at a gala for the church in 2013) is unlikely to be aired in the UK because of fears that the broadcaster could be exposed to libel claims . This is because it could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists. It mirrors the decision taken by British publishers Transworld to cancel their release of Lawrence Wright's Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief, on which the film is based. Hollywood star John Travolta slammed the film and said his decades of personal experience at the church have been positive. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times he said: 'I've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years...that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative.' The documentary claims to have revealed secrets about the church of Scientology, pictured is headquarters . Lawyers have warned that the show could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists such as Tom Cruise, pictured at a conference . The programme would be shielded by libel laws in Britain which state that people or organisations must now show 'serious harm' to reputation. But the same documentary would be exposed to pre-reform libel laws in Northern Ireland because Sky is unable to differentiate its signal between regions for technical reasons. Sky has maintained the decision is a delay rather than a cancellation. A spokesman said: 'At present, Sky's transmission date for Going Clear has not been confirmed.' The church has condemned the film as a 'one-sided, bigoted propaganda built on falsehoods' and informed by former members –whom it calls 'misfits'. It is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast. The church said in a statement: 'The Church of Scientology will be entitled to seek the protection of both UK and Irish libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions.' Going Clear examines the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, the church's finances and its relationships with celebrities such as Tom Cruise and  Travolta. Libel lawyer Paul Tweed, who was involved in previous discussion with UK publisher Transworld, which dropped Going Clear, said a decision to broadcast would be based on commercial reasons. The church is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast, pictured is leader David Miscavige . Alex Gibney (left) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members including Paul Haggis (right) 'Any client of mine, whether a journalist or a high-profile personality, is entitled to protect their reputation against false allegations,' he said. 'In terms of Sky's decision … they have to make absolutely certain that what they are broadcasting is not defamatory or untrue. If they have right on their side, they have nothing to fear.' Going Clear has been seen by more than 5.5 million people in the US and is likely to become second only to a film about Beyoncé as HBO’s most-watched documentary of the past decade. In a comment piece in the Los Angeles Times last week director Mr Gibney said: 'In the past, critics of the church have called for its tax exemption to be revoked because it is not a 'real religion'. I agree that tax-exemption isn't merited, but not for that reason. 'The Church of Scientology has a distinct belief system which, despite its somewhat strange cosmology – mocked by the TV show South Park and many others – is not essentially more strange than, say, the idea of a virgin birth. 'Scientologists are entitled to believe what they want to believe. And the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] website makes it clear anyone is entitled to start a religion without seeking IRS permission. To maintain the right to be tax-exempt, however, religions must fulfil certain requirements for charitable organisations. For example, they may not 'serve the private interests of any individual' and/or 'the organisation's purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy'.'\n",

            "A merry widow from Edinburgh who loves to party the night away dancing on tables admits her lifestyle is a far cry from her own grandparents. Pat Ingles, 69, remembers her grandmother sitting by the fire knitting in a pinny and slippers. In comparison, the retired hairdresser, prefers to dress up in kinky outfits and go out drinking until the early hours. Pat, 69, pictured left in her police woman fancy dress outfit, enjoys pole dancing with friend Julia, 67, right . 'I really enjoy myself, I party hard,' she admitted on the Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly. 'I have heard of the saying \"grow old gracefully\" but I don't understand it.' Grandmother-of-three Pat lost her husband 12 years ago to prostate cancer after dutifully caring for him during the last nine years of his life following his diagnosis. Now she's focused on enjoying herself and wants to make the most of the time she has left. She said: 'I have cared for people all my life. I don't want to look after someone full-time again, I want to look after me now. 'Whatever time I have left I am going to party and love it till I die.' Pat in another of her risque outfits gets to grips with an Elvis impersonator in Menorca . While Pat likes to hit the town at night, during the day she hits the gym and also enjoys pole-dancing lessons. Thanks to keeping fit and active, she says she feels confident about her appearance as she nears 70 and as a result, she is happy to show off her body in a number of 'kinky' outfits. Her wardrobe includes a risque fancy dress police woman look, air hostess and French Maid outfits, as well as a leather jumpsuit, and she teams them all with stilettos. She said: 'I like to dress sexy, if I can't walk in high heels, I won't go outside. I just like to have fun and feel good in whatever I wear. 'For my age I don't have a bad body. I can walk into a room and I still turn heads and I like that.' Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables . Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think \"my nanna shouldn't do that\", it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives . Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son. But now she's found happiness with Colin, 66. She said: 'We have a fantastic time together, we have good sex, we enjoy each others' company. 'I realised how much I missed that, having someone to care for me and protect me and treat me like a lady.' Julia shows off her pole dancing skills. She admits: 'I don't like the thought of getting old' OAPs Behaving Badly is on Channel 5 Wednesdays at 9pm .\n",

            "The 2013/14 season was seen as a step forward for Arsenal, spending the majority of the campaign at the top of the Premier League and ending their trophy drought with the FA Cup. But the Gunners still finished in fourth place yet again, with Arsene Wenger's team were heavily criticised after throwing away the title. That poor run of form in 2014 couldn't seem further away now with Arsenal flying in the league, a recent 4-1 victory against Liverpool demonstrating their step forward. But still, the north London side have exactly the same record as they did at this stage last season. Arsenal were reeling after a 6-0 defeat by Chelsea at this stage last season and had 63 points from 31 games . The Gunners are now in fine form and beat Liverpool 4-1 on Saturday but still have the exact same record . The Premier League table after Arsenal had played 31 games in 2013/14 (left), and now (right) Played 31, won 19, drawn six, lost six - the only stat differentiating the two tables is Arsenal's favourable goal difference in this campaign - a season which their points tally of 63 merits a place of second, rather than fourth. With the addition of Alexis Sanchez as well as a new-found solidity in Francis Coquelin and the goalscoring returns of Olivier Giroud and Mesut Ozil, the Gunners are already being tipped to challenge for the title next season. But the run of form at the start of the season - in contrast to 2013/14 when they impressed in the opening months - has cost Wenger. Defeats by Swansea, Stoke and Manchester United will be looked back on with regret by this Arsenal team, as well as dropping points late on at Liverpool and Tottenham. Mathieu Flamini celebrates after equalising in Arsenal's 31st game last season against Manchester City . The Gunners were in fine form at the beginning of the 2013/14 season and topped the table for many weeks . They currently top the European form guide but still can't beat their efforts from last year, at this stage at least. Wind back a year and Arsenal were reeling from a 6-0 defeat by Chelsea, drawing with Swansea and Manchester City before another humiliating loss at the hands of Everton. Things are certainly on the up for the Gunners now and they do look in fine shape heading into the summer, but they should not forget what could have been, this season and last. Arsene Wenger will regret many results in this season - including a 3-2 defeat by Stoke City in December .\n",

Xie Shisheng, who was just 16 years old when was imprisoned by the mill owner, was found in a small dark room by authorities earlier this week. Now 34, a very gaunt Xie, who did not know what year it was when he was rescued because he was so isolated from the outside world, said he was hit with a hammer, never fed properly and beaten daily. Rescued: Xie Shisheng, who was just 16 years old when was imprisoned by the mill owner, was found by police in small dark room by police . Government authorities in the city of Qingyuan in the north west Guangdong province were tipped off about an illegal cotton mill. When they arrived at the mill in Qing Cheng District on Wednesday, they found large quantities of fake cotton goods and another more unexpected discovery. Inside a locked room officials found Xie  making cotton products. Speaking with a stammer, he said that in 1997, aged 16, he voluntarily went to Qingyuan with the mill owner, but was locked away in cramped living quarters and treated like a slave. Each day he was given a huge workload and was beaten. 'They would often force feed me horrible things and when I would struggle they would hit me in the head with a hammer,' Xie said. 'The female owner would often urinate on me.' Tortured: Now 34, a very gaunt Xie said he was hit with a hammer, never fed properly and beaten daily . When government officials arrived in the Qing Cheng District on Wednesday, they found large quantities of fake cotton goods . Xie, originally from Jiangxi in the south east of the country, said that every few years the owners would change the place of work but that he was always imprisoned in a dark room without any natural light. In fact neighbours said they always had an inkling someone was being held illegally in the building. Neighbour Mr Xie said he could hear cries of pain every night which he initially thought were from a child being punished. Over time he knew there was someone held inside the building, but because the doors were always locked he couldn’t be sure. 'When the police arrived we helped the guy to leave the building,' Mr Xie said. 'He was shaking all over saying that if he left the building the owner would beat him to death.'

            "Adrian Heath is holding court at his weekly pre-match press conference, and one of the local reporters wants to talk crossbars. Might it be a good idea to raise it a bit so more goals could be scored for the benefit of goal-hungry American fans? The well-travelled former Everton and Manchester City midfielder – now manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City – responds with good humour. 'Well, soccer's being doing quite well for about 150 years now and if you look at the amount of people who play and watch it's still doing quite well, so I don't really see a need,' he replies with a patient smile. Scroll down for video . Adrian Heath is manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City . Such inquiries are actually becoming fewer and further between, as the world game and the huge US market get better acquainted with each other. Heath has been here for eight years now and witnessed the process at first hand, going from the backwoods of the USL to the major leagues that Orlando have been elevated to this season. The years have not dimmed Heath's impish enthusiasm and, now 53, he speaks of the game's expansion with an almost missionary zeal. Perched in the morning sunshine on a bench at City's pristine training facility he talks about the upside of salary caps, what Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard can expect, the humility of his star signing Kaka and his hopes of an eventual rivalry with David Beckham's troubled Miami project. Steven Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in the summer after spending 17 seasons at Liverpool . Midfielder Frank Lampard has signed a two-year contract with New York City . The aforementioned names' imminent arrival is just one reason why the MLS is achieving a greater resonance on the other side of the Atlantic. ' I think English people are fascinated with America,' says Heath. ' You see the baseball, American football and basketball and wonder whether football can take off here. I'm glad to say I think the only question is how big it becomes. 'Perhaps we have slowly had to educate some of the media. One of the things that has kept football down a bit is that some of the high profile media haven't known the sport, and maybe some people are scared of it. They guard their own sports quite carefully.' Heath's Stateside adventure began in the unlikely setting of a pub in his native Newcastle Under Lyme, where he bumped into Stoke City director Phil Rawlins. Kaka is playing out the final days of a distinguished career on the doorstep of Disney World . 'He was looking to invest in soccer over here and I had just lost my job at Coventry. I'd been with Coventry to Portland that year for a pre-season friendly and there were 15,000 people there. I thought the game was taking off and so I thought I'd try and get in early. 'I started off at the bottom in the USL in Austin, Texas. Sometimes there were less than 1,000 people in the ground, not great facilities, lot of college kids, but you could see the game growing. 'Now you look at Seattle Sounders and they would be not that far from Man United and Arsenal in average gates, getting 45,000 per game.' His belief that in ten years the MLS will be world's 'third or fourth biggest league' is fuelled by his daily influx of emails: ' I only have to open my inbox every day to see how many people want to come out here. All the time agents are offering me players who are going to be out of contract in two years' time, big international players who will may be be 29 then.' Orlando midfielder Kaka has the highest salary in MLS history . While Beckham is still looking for a ground in Miami – last month he made an unusually low profile visit in further efforts to resolve the issue – Orlando sold out their opening game last month at the temporary home of the Citrus Bowl. 'We got 62,000 our first game. That will not be sustained but we are building a 21,000 seater stadium with the capability of going up to 28,000 and we will fill that.' It helps having Kaka as the club's marquee signing, a superstar in name but evidently not in behaviour, as Heath quickly discovered: 'We went on pre-season to Charleston and we hired a few vans to transport everyone around. He volunteered to drive one of them and then would wait around for the kids who are straggling and the last to leave, to make sure they're not left behind. He's a remarkable person.' He knows what an impact the involvement of Beckham could also have if he can sort problems out 250 miles south, and admits a vested interest:' I think he has faced an uphill battle on the back of what happened with the baseball there. The city invested millions into the Marlins and they weren't happy with how it worked out with the owner. Midfielder Heath scored 71 goals in 226 games for Everton . 'There's nobody at this club that doesn't want to see David get it off the ground in Miami. Rivalry makes sports, and we could get that going with Miami and maybe Atlanta, which is also a few hours up the road. ' I think David will do it there, it's very difficult for a city to turn down a major league sport over here with all that it brings. One of things that has helped in Orlando is that it's a young city and they want to show it has a lot more to offer than Disney. The city has united behind this.' Gerrard and Lampard will be coming sooner and, he says, there will be a few culture shocks. ' They will have to get used to the travel for an away game. Six hour flights leaving on Thursday and not arriving back until Sunday night. The time difference, sleep patterns. 'I think they'll be impressed with the athleticism in the league. Six years ago coming here in your mid thirties you could get away with coasting but those days are gone. Frank will be fine and so will Steven because they've got great football brains.' Heath helped Everton lift eight trophies during his six years at Goodison Park . And they will find a much more level playing field.'The great thing about the MLS is because of the salary cap there is parity and you don't know who is going to win the league. The Premier League is exciting in many ways but you know only three or four teams can win it. ' Nobody is more patriotic than me and I'm very proud to have played for the likes of Everton and Man City. But the thought that Everton might never win another trophy doesn't sit well with me. They were level five years ago with Man City. It's unthinkable that Everton might not win anything again.' Heath is that rare bird in English football, the traveller, having also spent a season at Espanyol as a player. It has made him a better coach, although he admits his Spanish excursion was not about self-improvement. 'I earned more money going to Spain, one of the reasons we don't export any more from England is that we are the gravy train. If you want to earn a lot of money you stay in England. If you go back to the likes of me, Mark Hateley, Glenn Hoddle, Michael Robinson, the truth is we all went for more money. But it does help you learn.' Now he is doing something very unusual, having to effectively build a team from scratch after Orlando's 'promotion', working all the time within the salary cap. They currently lie third in the Eastern Conference after six games. 'The bottom line is we have got just under 4 million pounds to work with for 28 players (one of them is his son Harrison). You get three of them outside the wage cap but they count as 400 each against it so there is a lot of juggling.' Heath never gets homesick, and there is a constant flow of football people passing through from England, usually taking their children to Disneyland. 'The funny thing is that is brought my kids over quite a few times when I was a player and they were younger, but now I'm working here I've never set foot in the place.'\n",

            "Boss Tim Sherwood backed Christian Benteke to fire Aston Villa to safety after the striker's crucial hat-trick saved a point against QPR. The forward's treble - his first in two years - clinched a pulsating 3-3 draw with their drop rivals as Villa edged further clear of the bottom three. Villa are three points above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and denied QPR the chance to leapfrog them in the table. Christian Benteke scored a stunning hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers . Manager Tim Sherwood said that Benteke can fire Villa to Premier League safety . Defeat would have left Villa in the relegation zone and behind QPR but Benteke struck a 25-yard free-kick with seven minutes left to save them and complete his treble. The Belgium international has seven goals in seven games under Sherwood and the boss hopes he can maintain his form to keep Villa up. He said: 'That's the plan. 'It doesn't come much better than that. He's a good player, I have always said it and he's in a rich vein of form. 'It's fantastic for him to score the goals, it's just a shame we couldn't get the three points. 'It's not about what you deserve, it's about what you get and we got one point. 'This could be a vital point come the end of the season in the end, when you go so late into the game and Christian has had to pull that out the bag we're grateful.' But Sherwood insisted Villa should have won after Benteke's first-half double, cancelling out Matt Phillips' opener, gave them a 2-1 lead at the break. He said: 'It's disappointing when you dominate a football match like that, the ref should have stopped it at half-time. QPR were only ahead for three minutes in the first half after Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh goal of the season early on . 'I thought we tired in the second half but that's to be expected and two of those back four have trained about four times in eight weeks. We dropped off a little bit too deep and couldn't keep that pressure on them. 'But anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn't have been close.' Rangers hit back after the break through Clint Hill and Charlie Austin, the latter netting with just 12 minutes left. They have taken four points from their last two away games after winning just once on the road this season before Saturday's 4-1 win at West Brom. The draw, though, left them two points from safety having played a game more and boss Chris Ramsey admitted he was nervous after Austin's goal. He said: 'It's a long time, it's heart attack time for managers that. You can see you're going to win but you know there's a chance anything can happen, a free-kick, a corner or a bit of magic. Benteke's added two more, including this wonder free-kick - much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night . 'I thought we could (hang on) but a free-kick is a free-kick, at that stage most of their attacking options had been exhausted. 'I'm disappointed if I'm being honest. But before the game if someone said we'd get four points from the last two games we probably would have taken that.' Rangers were seeking back-to-back away wins in the top flight for the first time since 1995 but Ramsey targeted home victories to keep them up. They host Chelsea on Sunday before welcoming West Ham and Newcastle to Loftus Road. He said: 'I don't know what we need but we're probably going to have to win three games. I don't know what the points total will be but our two home games are going to be very important after Chelsea. 'We have got a couple of very difficult ones in Liverpool and Manchester City and then we have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last day of the season. 'Most teams would take being in it right to the end and then roll the dice, you don't want to start being detached because it's a big mountain to climb.'\n",

            "It is the age old debate but with a modern twist: which Premier League club is the most popular according to Twitter followers. For the first time ever, fans can see a detailed breakdown of how support for every club varies around the world and in the UK supporters can go as in-depth as seeing the three most popular teams in their local constituency. So, what exactly does the data show? The map was created by looking at the official Twitter accounts for each team, using their followers as an indicator of allegiance. Fans can toggle the map to view their club's support worldwide, see the most popular clubs globally and compare their club with a rival. Using the 'Zoom to' function fans can also look at any country around the world. Liverpool may be struggling in the Premier League and looking at a 2015-16 campaign without Champions League football, but in terms of Twitter followers they dominate the UK. Arsenal have strong support in London and the south east and actually have more followers in the backyards of rivals Chelsea and Tottenham. In Manchester, it is a win for Louis van Gaal's United who dominate the area apart from Gorton where rivals City are more popular. United also have pockets of concentrated support across the UK. Chelsea have strong support in the Western Isles, while clubs such as Newcastle, Sunderland, Hull City, Burnley, Stoke City, Leicester City, Aston Villa, Swansea and Southampton dominate their local areas. But while Liverpool completely dominate the UK market, their global appeal is less impressive. Brendan Rodgers' side have a large following across the world with strong support in Thailand, Norway, Iceland, Uruguay and Australia but find themselves playing second fiddle to the Premier League's other giants in other areas. For instance, the rest of Asia apart from Thailand is dominated by Manchester United - who have strong followings in India and Pakistan and edge out Chelsea in Malaysia and Indonesia, too. While in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines it is Arsenal who come out on top. The UK (left) is dominated by Liverpool green while South America (right) is very much a strong hold of Chelsea . London and the south east is a sea of yellow reflecting Arsenal's domination, with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Liverpool (green) North America is somewhat surprisingly dominated by Arsenal (yellow) with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Man United (red) Eden Hazard (left) and Ramires (right) in action for Chelsea against a MLS All-Star team during the club's 2012 tour of America . Somewhat surprisingly, United are only the third best supported team in America - despite touring the states frequently over the years and having American owners. Chelsea beat Van Gaal's side to second but it is Arsenal - whose largest shareholder is American Stan Kroenke - who dominate across the pond. Arsenal and Chelsea also split Europe, with Arsene Wenger's side most popular in northern European countries such as France, Germany and Poland and Chelsea taking the south. Arsenal are also well supported in northern Africa (Algeria and Morocco) but further south United turn South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe red. Across the globe, Arsenal are the most popular team with 5.6million followers, followed by Chelsea (5.4m) and Manchester United (4.8m). The reasons behind support for a club in any country or area are of course complicated, but certain trends can be explained. For instance, there is often huge support in certain countries for national heroes. Ivory Coast is pro-Chelsea because of Didier Drogba, Uruguay is a Liverpool stronghold due to the now departed Luis Suarez and Bosnia and Herzegovina is light blue thanks to Edin Dzeko's presence at Manchester City. Arsenal went on tour to Asia in 2013 and they will take part in the 2015 Premier League Asia Trophy in Singapore in the summer . In Asia it is Manchester United (red) who just edge the overall support from Chelsea (blue) and Arsenal (yellow) Liverpool dominate Twitter followers in Australia with pockets of support for Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United as well . The Melbourne Cricket Ground was packed to 95,000 capacity when Liverpool took on Melbourne Victory in July 2013 . And this trend doesn't just happen at the so-called bigger Premier League clubs. Swansea are well supported in South Korea and Iceland presumably because of Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Enner Valencia being at Upton Park has boosted West Ham's following in the striker's native Ecuador and Everton are still popular in Cameroon even though Samuel Eto'o has left the club. Owners may also have a factor - in Malaysia QPR have a stronger-than-average following which could be attributed to the popularity of the club's owner Tony Fernandes in the country.

            "At the helm of the NYPD from 1934-45 was Lewis Valentine (pictured), a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years who had a reputation for brutality . Today they are everyday heroes, New York's finest, but the New York Police Department has had a more chequered past than most would imagine. Bernard Whalen's new book 'The NYPD's First Fifty Years' is a tale of kickbacks, mob violence and secret KKK members. Whalen charts the early rise of the world renowned police department from it beginnings in 1898 when the New York area's 18 independent police forces merged into one. A variety of men led the force through its formative years, 21 in total. Some were forward looking, some were practical but more than a fair share were scoundrels, larcenists or at the very least guilty of dereliction of duty. The department's first chief of police, William Devery, who held the post from 1898-1901, was known as the king of kickbacks. A former bar tender, Devery had to give a backhander just to get into the force, and was never shy about trading dollars for ranks, the New York Post reported. Police officers of the time had to pay exorbitant fees, more than year's starting salary to become a captain, but for Devery the under the table payments could easily be recovered through other means. In his early career, when taking command of a lower East Side Police Precinct, Devery was recorded as saying that there was a great deal of 'grafting' going on among his subordinates and that he would put a stop to it so he could line his own pockets. On the back of bribes paid to him Devery was able to buy a baseball team, the New York Highlanders, a forerunner to the New York Yankees, which he eventually sold for $300,000 in 1915. Theodore Bingham who held Devery's former post from 1906 to 1909 had his own unique set of character traits and is described in 'The NYPD's First Fifty Years' as being pathologically blunt. A former Brigadier General, Bingham lost his leg in an Army engineering accident in Buffalo. He worked throughout his career to remove special civil service protections on police inspectors who he could not promote or demote. When he won his battle to fire the people he wanted he turned his attention to NYPD captains who had the same status. He was recorded as saying 'I wish that about 40 police captains would die overnight. They are no good.' Bingham's tendency for indiscretion landed him in hot water again when he let slip the whereabouts one of his top lieutenants who had become famous for tracking down the mob. The police chief decided to tell reporters that his star lieutenant was on a secret mission in Italy tracking down the criminal backgrounds of Mafioso, Black Hand members. The officer was later found, shot dead outside a Palermo café. Devery (left) was the king of kickbacks while Theodore Bingham (right) was 'pathologically blunt' Richard Entright who presided over the NYPD from 1918 to 1925 has become infamous for his decision not to root out Klu Klux Klan members in his own force. He was handed orders from the then mayor of New York to look into allegations that one of the city's Baptist ministers was allowing the white supremacist group to recruit from among his parishioners. The extent of KKK influence in the city was far greater than either Entright or Mayor John Francis Hylan knew and an astonishing 800 suspected Klansmen were found to be living in New York – 30 of them were police officers. Richard Entright (pictured) failed to even try and remove the KKK from within his own police force . Presented with the size of the problem and information that as far as it was known none of the individuals had broken the law, Entright decided to do nothing. Joseph Warren, chief of police for only one year from 1927 to 28 became famous for incompetence rather than any particularly nefarious acts. Upon the death of Arnold Rothstein, once New York's most notorious gangsters and the real-life inspiration for F. Scott Fitzgerald's character, Meyer Wolfsheim, in 'The Great Gatsby', warren told his top detective to take a holiday. Warren, who it has emerged may have suffered from mental problems, fumbled the open and shut case and, as Warren was pushed from his post, the key suspect walked free. At the helm of the NYPD from 1934-45 was Lewis Valentine, a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years. Valentine, whose autobiography was appropriately titled, 'Nightstick' and who would later host a radio show, 'Gang Busters,' was the embodiment of a tough cop. Under his tenure NYPD officers were encouraged to mercilessly beat their suspects and promotions were on offer to those who could – in Valentine's words 'throw the gorillas around'. Following the slow death of one officer who had been killed a week earlier Valentine ordered his men to shoot 'wise guys' on sight, telling them they shoulf 'draw quickly and shoot accurately'.\n",

            "Up to 100 Islamic teachers could be banned from working in schools for life following an investigation into their alleged links to the Trojan Horse scandal. It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video . Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated . It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax . In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools . The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group. An estimated 35 per cent of the population practise Islam, compared with 4.4 per cent across the country according to the latest census.\n",

            "Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence shake-up. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences. Information about penalty points for traffic violations such as speeding will be held only on the DVLA’s database, and will have to be checked online, by phone or by post. But motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details. Scroll down for video . Changes: Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence (file picture) shake-up . Concerns: Motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details . From June 8, holidaymakers heading abroad will have to log on to the DVLA website the day before and put in their driving licence number to obtain a special code to give to their car hire company when they arrive at the desk. But fears are growing that the ‘muddled’ introduction of the new rules will mean people could be turned away because many car hire firms abroad will still insist on examining the paper document to check for endorsements or bans. Furthermore, the passcode is valid for only 72 hours, meaning anyone hiring a car in the second week of their trip faces having to find an internet cafe or pay expensive roaming charges. Mark Bower, of the car hire insurance website MoneyMaxim, said holidaymakers could endure major problems at car hire desks across Europe. He added: ‘Most people are simply unaware that these changes are on the way – and it is not just renters. ‘I spoke to one big car hire firm in Portugal this week and they knew nothing of the changes. Six weeks away from implementation, the whole thing is very muddled. ‘It is another thing you have to remember to do just before departure. Or you can do it at the desk with your smartphone if you can remember the website address, don’t mind the data roaming charges, can remember your national insurance number and are impervious to the long queue developing behind you.’ The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences (file picture) Mr Bower also said unscrupulous firms might use the issue as ‘another excuse’ to persuade people to pay for extra insurance. Motorists will also be able to download their driving history as a printable PDF file, although it is unclear whether all car hire firms will accept that, or how drivers without access to a computer will cope. The DVLA insists the changes have been widely publicised. But consumers booking car hire for holidays after June have not been warned the new rules are being introduced. The terms and conditions of most car hire firms still explicitly state that paper counterparts must be produced. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, which represents the industry, says UK hirers unaware of the rule change will be treated in the same way as those who currently turn up without both parts of the licence. The DVLA said the system, called Share Driving Licence, would be ready in time for June 8. A spokesman said: ‘There is up-to-date information on the website and we are working closely with the industry to ensure that their systems and processes are ready for the changes.’ The two-part licence was introduced in 1998 but many drivers found it inconvenient. From June 8, paper counterparts will be invalid and should be destroyed. Motorists with old-style paper driving licences from before 1998 can continue to use them.\n",

            "A Ferrari-driving fantasist dubbed 'Teflon Don' who murdered his wealthy heiress lover in order to steal £816,000 from her bank accounts has been ordered to pay back just £1. Donald Graham, 62, from Sparty Lea, Northumberland, killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, so he could fund his lavish taste in supercars and buy his second mistress a home. Ms Brown vanished in 2005 and her body has never been found. Scroll down for video . Donald Graham, 62, (pictured) killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, his lover, for her money . He stole £300,000 of her savings, her Land Rover and Porsche, took her horses and tried to siphon off thousands of pounds from her estate and that of her family. Graham, who dubbed himself Teflon Don, was last year jailed for life with a minimum of 32 years for killing Ms Brown for her money nine years after her death. Prosecutors wanted to reclaim his ill-gotten gains, which they said totalled £816,127.86p, under the Proceeds of Crime Act. But Newcastle Crown Court heard Graham, previously referred to in court as the Prince of Darkness, now has no available assets and so must pay back just back £1. Janet Brown (pictured left) and Graham (right) were lovers for eight years despite Graham being married . Graham, who drove a Ferrari, a Porsche, a Range Rover and a Alfa Romeo Spider, despite allegedly being short of cash, denied murdering Ms Brown between June 14 and 18, 2005 but admitted stealing her money. But jurors, who had been deliberating over the case for a week, found him guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice during a trial last year. The court heard the Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has ever been found. Graham spun a cruel web of lies that left Ms Brown’s parents believing she was still alive but living abroad. Graham, described as ‘flash’ and always ‘dripping in gold’, lived with his wife Denise, 66, but had two mistresses, including Ms Brown. Graham and Ms Brown,who had saved ‘substantial assets’ of over £400,000, had been together for eight years. He told her that his wife had cancer and when she died they would marry. The Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has been found . The pair arranged to go on holiday to France in 2005 but at the last minute he pulled out, claiming his wife was unwell, so Miss Brown decided to go alone. The court heard that after booking the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with whom he had become infatuated. It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that Ms Brown was murdered. Graham had persuaded her to transfer £300,000 into his account and the money dropped just a day before she disappeared. Jurors were told that Graham wanted Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in. During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court, the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham. During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham (pictured in long leather jacket) The trial judge said Ms Brown, whose body has never been found, may have been dumped in a deep pit or mine shaft by former JCB digger driver Graham. Her killer was badly in debt and was struggling to fund the finance agreements on his beloved sports cars. He plundered Ms Brown's bank account to fund his flashy lifestyle, making her elderly parents, Eric and Olive Brown, believe their daughter was still alive by sending them letters and cards in her name from Europe. Graham also ingratiated himself with her parents after her death and started systematically stripping their estate and assets. He used his visits to gain access to Ms Brown's security codes and also sold her Porsche and other cars. When her parents died, he plundered their bank accounts - defrauding a total of more than £500,000 from them. The couple died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was working in a bank in Switzerland. After they died building society staff eventually became suspicious that withdrawals were still being made in 2010 and police were called. They believed they were just investigating a fraud but it soon became apparent Ms Brown was missing and a murder inquiry was launched. He hadn't worked since an accident in 1997 when a JCB bucket hit him on the back and he was awarded £40,000 compensation. Graham was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for killing Ms Brown. Northumbria Police subsequently launched an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act into his finances. Graham stole more than £800,000 from Ms Brown to fund his love of supercars and a lavish lifestyle . The court heard with his fleet of flash sports cars and his large imposing house on a hill, pony-tailed and goatee-bearded Graham thought of himself as a charmer and cut a distinctive figure in his long leather coat. He liked to play the big man, pretending to be related to murdered Viv Graham who was shot and killed in an unsolved apparent gangland hit in 1993, in an effort to enhance his reputation as a force to be reckoned with. In fact he was a failed former policeman in the Met, having quit after a week in the 1970s, apparently homesick for his native North East. The court heard Graham's main motivation in life was always money and he had a penchant for women over whom he could exert power and control. Graham was jailed for life  for killing Ms Brown. Police are pictured searching for her body in Northumberland .\n",

            "The family of an American hostage killed in a US drone strike gave his Al Qaeda captors money in a failed bid to guarantee his release, a report suggests. It has also been claimed Dr Warren Weinstein, from Rockville, Maryland, and a fellow aid worker were used as a shield to protect a senior Al Qaeda operative while in captivity. The 73-year-old was killed alongside Giovanni Lo Porto during an anti-terrorist strike on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border intended to kill members of the group. His family yesterday slammed their response to his abduction, and it has now been claimed that they transferred an undisclosed amount of money to his kidnappers two years before his death. A source in Pakistan who was in regular contact with the captors told CNN that after the money exchanged hands, they started demanding the release of prominent Afghan prisoners. They included the 'poster girl' for jihad Dr. Aafia Siddiqui - who is currently serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States for the attempted murder of a United States Army captain. Sources suggest the family of American hostage Dr Warren Weinstein, who was killed during a US drone strike in January, gave money to his kidnappers. His wife Elaine (right) has already slammed the US government's response to his abduction . After the money allegedly changed hands, the captors are said to have demanded the release of prominent Afghan prisoners, including the 'poster girl' for jihad Dr. Aafia Siddiqui - who is currently serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States . He said they were professional during the transactions and they connected themselves to other abductions - including that of murdered journalist James Foley. The source told CNN the militants would call him on a daily basis and when he last spoke to them in early April, they said Weinstein was still alive. However they did not provide a proof of life. When they stopped calling, CNN's source could not contact them as he had no phone number for the captors. He did not reveal how much money had been handed over. According to CBS News' David Martin, Dr Weinstein and Mr Lo Porto may have been used to safeguard an Al Qaeda leader while they were in the compound. US officials have not revealed a specific individual that was targeted during the attacks, but said the compound was hit because intelligence strongly suggested militants were inside. The senior member of the terrorist organisation may have believed if opposition forces knew hostages were in the compound, he would be safe from drone strikes. It has also been claimed that Dr Weinstein (left) and  fellow captive Giovanni Lo Porto (right) were used to shield a senior Al Qaeda operative from drone strikes . The leader being shielded was Ahmed Farouq, a longtime al Qaeda operative who once hatched a plot to hijack Pakistani vessels and ram them into American warships, the station reported. President Obama has taken 'full responsibility' for the attack which killed Dr Weinstein and Italian aid worker Mr Lo Porto in January. Weinstein's wife Elaine has said the US government's reaction to his plight following his capture in Lahore, Pakistan, in 2011 was 'inconsistent and disappointing'. In a statement released on Thursday, she said her family were devastated by the news he will never return home. She said: 'On behalf of myself, our two daughters, our son-in-law, and two grandchildren, we are devastated by this news and the knowledge that my husband will never safely return home. Pictured next to his wife are his two daughters, his son-in-law and two granddaughters . 'We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through. We do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding Warren's death but we do understand that the U.S. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances. 'We look forward to the results of that investigation. But those who took Warren captive over three years ago bear ultimate responsibility. I can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan. 'The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions,' Mrs. Weinstein said. 'Warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people's lives better. In Pakistan, where he was working before he was abducted, he loved and respected the Pakistani people and their culture. He learned to speak Urdu and did everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region. 'We cannot even begin to express the pain our family is going through and we ask for the respect of our privacy as we go through this devastating ordeal.' 'I want to thank Congressman John Delaney, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and Senator Ben Cardin - as well as specific officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation - for their relentless efforts to free my husband. 'Unfortunately, the assistance we received from other elements of the U.S. Government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years. We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. Government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families.' 'I am disappointed in the government and military in Pakistan. Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority. I hope the nature of our future relationship with Pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these.' During a press conference on Thursday, President Obama  revealed two other Americans, both prominent members of the terrorist organization, were killed in during missions in the same region. Ahmed Farouq, an American who was an Al Qaeda leader, was killed in the same January operation that resulted in the hostages' deaths while notorious hate preacher and US-native Adam Gadahn was killed in a separate US mission. The commander-in-chief gave his 'deepest apologies' to the families and revealed he had spoken to Weinstein's wife and the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Wednesday. President Obama has taken 'full responsibility' for the attack which killed Dr Warren Weinstein, admitting that US forces sometimes make 'deadly mistakes' Defending the operation, he said it was 'fully consistent' with guidelines set out for counter-terrorist missions. 'As a husband and as a father, I cannot begin to imagine the anguish that the Weinstein and Lo Porto families are enduring today,' Obama told reporters, with a deep sigh. 'I profoundly regret what happened,' Obama said, explaining he declassified some of the details of the operation so that the families could know what happened.' 'There could be no starker contrast between these two men and their captors.' He added there will be a full review into the deadly incident and his press secretary, Josh Earnest, later said both of the victims will be given compensation by the US government. Earnest did not reveal how much they would receive, but the figure could be in the millions.\n",

            "Oklahoma introduced a law allowing it to use nitrogen gas to kill death row prisoners if lethal injections aren't available. Governor Mary Fallin signed into law a bill approving nitrogen as an alternative method of death, giving Oklahoma four different ways to enact its death penalty. The method, which involves pumping a chamber full of nitrogen and leaving a prisoner's body to die from lack of oxygen, has been touted as 'foolproof' by supporters, in the wake of the embarrassingly botched lethal injections. Scroll down for video . Gas chamber: The state of Oklahoma has legalized killing death row in-mates with nitrogen. This 1999 file photo shows an Arizona correctional officer explaining his state's execution method . Executions in the state are currently on hold while the Supreme Court ponders whether the three-drug mix now favored by Oklahoma is constitutional. The pause follows an infamous execution last ear, which saw officials struggle to administer a the poison to an inmate, who writhed on the gurney in pain for some 43 minutes before finally dying. Nitrogen - which has never been used to execute humans before - is now the state's second choice. The new bill, effective from November 2015, moves the electric chair back from second preference to third, while firing squad becomes a distant fourth choice if all other methods are unavailable. Proponents tout that nitrogen killings will be 'fast and painless' for inmates - and also say the method is 'foolproof' as it requires no medical expertise or complex procedures. In a statement issued as the bill was signed, Fallin, a Republican, said: 'Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous. 'I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard.' The bill authored by Republican Rep. Mike Christian and Republican Sen. Anthony Sykes had passed the state House on an 85-10 vote and cleared the Senate on a 41-0 vote. Christian, a former Highway Patrol trooper, said: 'The process is fast and painless - it's foolproof.' Opponents say there's no way to know whether the method is painless and effective. 'It just hasn't been tried, so we don't know,' said Rep. Emily Virgin, a Democrat from Norman who opposes the death penalty. The changes come after a botched execution last year in which Oklahoma was using a new sedative as the first in a three-drug combination. State officials tried to halt the lethal injection after the inmate writhed on the gurney and moaned. He died 43 minutes after the process began. Adam Leathers, spokesman for the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, released a statement blasting the new law. 'This is not only a grotesque waste of resources but indicative of a corrupt value system,' he said. 'It is sad to know that our State's collective bloodlust is so unabated that our leadership feels the need to spend resources to put a back up system into place so State sponsored murder can go on uninterrupted.' The problematic execution was blamed on a poorly placed intravenous line and prompted a lawsuit from Oklahoma death row inmates, who argue that the state's new drug combination presents a serious risk of pain and suffering. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments later this month. The lack of readily-available lethal injection drugs - and problems with stocks the states do have - has vexed several other states. Utah brought back the firing squad earlier this year in response to a drugs shortage, while Tennessee reinstated the electric chair.\n",

            "Punters have reacted with a mixture of amusement and fury to the announcement Future Music Festival will not return to Australia in 2016. Many people were genuinely upset over the cancellation - blaming the festival organisers for sending themselves broke by spending too much money on headline acts Drake and Avicii. But others were quick to make fun of Future festival goers, blaming 'shirtless f***wits' for ruining the festival and joking that 'gym memberships and ecstasy dealers' would be hardest hit. Scroll down for video . Music fans pose during the Future Music Festival at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse in February this year . Punters have reacted with a mixture amusement and fury to the announcement Future Music Festival will not return to Australia in 2016 . 'What will we do with all the d*****bags in singlets?' Adam Connelly joked on Twitter. 'BUT WHERE WILL I WALK AROUND WITHOUT A SHIRT WHILST ON PINGAZ?!' Jake Finnigan posted on Facebook. More than 230 people were arrested over drug-related offences at Future Music Festival events around the country, which took place in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane between February 28 and March 9. On Thursday, organisers of the annual event released a statement announcing that it has been cancelled. Many people were genuinely upset over the announcement - blaming the festival organisers for sending themselves broke by spending too much money on headline acts Drake and Avicii . In a statement it was explained that due to low ticket sales and high operational costs, the festival could not continue . In the beginning: The festival first began in 2006 as a standalone one day festival in Sydney . 'It’s been a difficult decision to make but in the end travelling the festival in its current form across Australia simply doesn’t make financial sense anymore' the statement read. Following Thursday's announcement, music fans took to social media to express their disappointment. 'I've been to 5 out of the last 6 futures in Sydney and it's always been my favourite festival. However it was pretty obvious with your lineup this year that there was trouble in the camp,' Matt Duffy wrote on Facebook. 'I reckon Avicii and Drake alone would of sent you broke! I hope some people get crucified for this!' Following Thursday's announcement, music fans took to social media to express their disappointment . The decision comes just one month after the festival made its way through the major cities in the country . Meanwhile Faith Van Lith posted: 'These \"superstar\" DJs need to stop charging such retarded amounts of money they are destroying their own industry.' Another fan posted on Twitter: 'Future Music festival [because] DJs charge way too much. I mean is it really necessary to charge 250K for an hour?' Promoting company Mushroom Group released a subsequent statement explaining the decision. 'Despite the considerable critical acclaim of the 2015 festival, the last two years of ticket sales for the festival have underperformed, meaning Future Music Festival will not be returning in 2016'. Last time: The decision came just one month after the festival made its way around the country and was headlined by Avicii . On stage: Canadian rapper Drake was also a co-headliner at the dance festival this year . The decision comes just one month after the festival made its way through the major cities in the country this year, which was headlined by rapper Drake and DJ Avicii. Speaking to The Music  Group Chairman Michael Gudinski said: '...the cost to physically stage the events has significantly increased, even in just two years.' 'The fluctuating dollar also hasn’t helped and the increasing popularity of EDM [electronic dance music] in the States has seen DJ fees escalating out of control.' Mixing it up: Known for blending dance and rap artists in to the lineup, Macklemore performed on the 2014 bill . Gudinski believes that touring festivals will eventually be phased out altogether in Australia. '...Australia is following a trend that’s already been seen in America where touring festivals have become a thing of the past...Instead, stand-alone location festivals such as Coachella and Lollapalooza are going from strength to strength.' There is some positive news for disappointed fans as it was confirmed that the under 18 version of the festival, Good Life will continue. Crowd favoruites: Dance group The Prodigy performed at this years festival as well in 2013 and 2010 . Back to work: Future Music also marked the first slew of shows for singer Example this year after taking time off to be with his wife and newborn son . On the road: The festival's huge success saw it travel to Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Adelaide from 2007 onward . Mushroom Group also announced they are planning 'a new festival concept' which will take place in the same period that Future Music was held. The festival first began in 2006 as a standalone one day festival in Sydney, however its huge success saw it travel to Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Adelaide from the next year onward. Some local and international talent who have taken to the Future Music stage over the years include The Prodigy, Bloc Party, Skrillex, Rita Ora, Kesha and Macklemore.\n",

            "Mike Brown admitted he would adopt a 'cautious' approach in recovering from his latest concussion setback. The England full-back remains unsure when he will return after pulling out of Harlequins' Aviva Premiership clash with Saracens at Wembley last weekend. Northampton wing George North has been advised by leading medics not to play again this season after suffering four quick-fire concussions, while Ireland's Johnny Sexton was stood down for 12 weeks earlier this term. England full back Mike Brown admits he is unsure when he will return to action for club side Harlequins . Brown is determined not to suffer an extended break - so will not rush himself back to action ahead of time. 'It was just after the France game, there wasn't one incident where I was dizzy or concussed, but after the game I just didn't feel quite right,' said Brown. 'I had a headache the Sunday and Monday, so just being cautious with it, I don't want to get into the situation where you get a few knockouts or something. 'You don't want to be into a situation where you're out for a long time like Johnny Sexton or Geoff Parling or something like that. 'So with what's coming up at the end of the year, everyone's being cautious, and I'm being cautious as well. George North will not play against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday and will see a neurosurgeon . North suffered his fourth quick-fire concussion after being knocked out against Wasps on Friday night . 'I think it's just ongoing to see how I am stage by stage. 'I'll just see how I am with the stages, do the 20-minute bike, see how I am after that and take it from there.' Brown was knocked out cold in England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in the second round of RBS 6 Nations action in February. The Harlequins flyer had hoped to recover in time to face Ireland in Dublin on March 1, but pulled out in the build-up. Brown said increased awareness of the symptoms of concussion, driven by players undergoing World Rugby online modules, helped him realise he would not be ready to face Ireland. Brown (left) was knocked out cold in England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in February . The full back (centre) was immediately treated by the England medical team after being concussed vs Italy . 'Learning about all the symptoms was massive,' said Brown, speaking for Land Rover's 'We Deal In Real' campaign. 'I pulled out on the Tuesday before the Ireland game with the symptoms, and I could maybe have tried to carry on with training, but being aware of the symptoms was important. 'So just knowing the dangers of the long and short-term dangers, how important it is to be honest and how serious it can be, I think those are the main things I took from the online courses. 'After the France game I had a headache and could (have) easily thought \"it's Sarries, it's Wembley and I'll give it a go\", but we're so clued up on it now that I don't think anyone would risk it. Brown (right) says he suffered a headache after playing in England's clash against France last month . 'If I can do it, pulling out of England-Ireland, the biggest game of the Six Nations at that point, then I think anyone can do it, and should do it. 'Now I've been through it I would definitely talk to team-mates urging them not to play on if I thought they were showing symptoms. 'At the time you think it's a pain but now I'm very glad I took those online modules. 'It's just not worth pushing through.' Land Rover Ambassador Mike Brown was speaking at the launch of 'We Deal In Real', Land Rover's Rugby World Cup 2015 campaign that champions people at the heart and soul of the game by putting grassroots clubs on the global stage. www.landrover.com/rugby @LandRoverRugby £WeDealInReal .\n",

            "Lewis Hamilton is creating a bit of a track record for himself  - and this one isn't on the starting grid. Celebrating his win at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday, he sprayed champagne straight into the face of one of the hostesses. But a leading group which campaigns against sexism has condemned the behavior of the driver - who used to date ex-Pussy Cat Doll Nicole Scherzinger - as 'selfish and inconsiderate', saying he should be forced to apologise for 'specially directing' the bubbly into the woman's face. Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his behaviour showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'. Scroll down for video . Right in the ear: Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Chinese Grand Prix by spraying the hostess in the face with champagne . Not impressed: The hostess looks less than impressed as she is sprayed with champagne on the podium in Shanghai on Sunday . Trademark move: It's not the first time the racing ace has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . Caught by surprise: The hostess's colleagues laugh in the background as she gets a soaking from the champion British racing driver . Drenched: Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship . Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object, a campaign on media sexism and 'sex object culture', said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'. Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. Sprayed: He's made it a signature move, here Hamilton sprays a hostess at Montmelo at the Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya . But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday. But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference. His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’ Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' Soaked: It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference . Smiles: The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning the Chinese Formula One on Sunday . A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.

            "Adding a gritty edge to Tuesday at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Australia, Phoenix Keating, Alice McCall, Zhivago and Khim Hangall embraced a raw, punk style on the catwalk. Punk fashion took to the runway at Sydney's Carriageworks, with stocking caps, fishnets, tattoos and leather harnesses reigning the catwalk. Khim Hang, 22, displayed a bold collection with brooding models donning stocking caps and attire that could be likened to that of war soldiers. Scroll down for video . Karate Kids: Models go oriental with loose metallic  pants, skorts and tied kimono blazers at Khim Hang . Eighties revival: Fishnets were brought back into fashion in the new Phoenix Keating collection . Tatts are back: Models were seen to have a colourful display of tattoos on show at the Alice McCall show . Spice up your life: Model is seen wearing nineties Spice Girls bun hair style on runway at Phoenix Keating . The collection, which adopted its own  punk-look, showed a strong oriental influence - an obvious nod to his cultural background (his parents are originally from Cambodia). The line featured oriental influenced prints, rigid soldier tailoring as seen in the kimono jackets, waist ties, loose pants and eyebrow raising stocking shoes and caps that could overall look be described as a modern fusion of war soldier meets lay monk. This year also marks a record for Hang who has been said to be the youngest designer to show at MBFWA. Green with envy: Metallic shades of olive green and emerald dominated on the Zhivago runway . Killer geishas: Models mimic geishas in with white asymmetrical dresses and gold shoes at Zhivago . At 22, the Brisbane designer already has over 30 international stockists - despite it only being his third year as a designer. Fashion Bloggers star Margaret Zhang teamed up with the designer to style the runway show. In a striking contrast to Hang's conservative punk adoption, dark eyes, wet hair a sexy  attitude ruled at Phoenix Keating runway. Prom night: Model wears Barbie pink prom inspired dress at Alice McCall but loses a sleeve along the way . Sydney-based designer, Phoenix Keating, who has previously wowed the likes of Lady Gaga, brought a dark, glam punk showcase with fish netted models taking to the runway with bronzed skin, smoky eyes and wet look hair. The collection  featured black satin and emerald crepe fabrics amongst the fishnet overlays and captured the on-trend netting style seen in sport luxe looks, but adding a sophisticated, edge to the smouldering models. Satin show stopper: Black satin was used in conjunction with fishnet fabric to add sexy, edge to Keating show . Oversized office attire: Models wore lose black and white pants and men style shirts in the Khim Hang show . The Alice McCall show also grabbed the audience's attention in a clearly visual punk representation, with colourful, tattoos displayed across the back of a catwalk model. The model wore a open backed top, which clearly highlighted the punk-rock tattoos, a obvious statement rebelling against the fashion norm, in what follows throughout the gritty collection. Contrasting the tattoo laden model, another model mimics a prom Barbie, with innocent blonde locks and a satin pink frock, but is fast made punk with smoky eyes reminiscent of the heroine chic look. Crepe on the catwalk: Models wear crepe, flowing dresses at the  Michael Lo Sordo . Corporate cool: Models wear sophisticated high-neck designs at the Ginger and Smart show . The model  is also seen to lose one of her sleeves mid-catwalk in what's not is a mistake or a obvious tribute to her late night, rolled-out-of a-gutter chic look. The last triumphant punk  look came from Western Australian design duo Zhivago. Zhivago's Lara Kovacevich and Lydia Tsvetnenko swapped rag-doll, wet look hair for bold, black, cut-throat bob-cut wigs, in what can be described as a killer geisha models. All that glitters: Models wear  gold asymmetrical dress (left) and contrasting muted grey (right) at Toni Maticevski . White out: It was all about crisp, textured whites at the Haryono Setiadi show . Wearing leather harnessed stiletto heels, striking black wigs, high-cut asymmetrical dresses and arm cuffs the collection was a strong edition to the modern punk look on display. Models also were seen to have dark eye lined eyes and dominant brushed eyebrows. The remaining designers that presented including Jason Brunsdon, Toni Maticveski, Ginger and Smart,Michael Lo Sordo and One Fell Swoop chose to take a more safe approach, sticking with classic couture - with frills, pastels, draping and long-line gowns.

            "It's the fat-shaming/fit-shaming controversy that's refusing to go away . Online fitness company Protein World caused a Twitter storm recently with its London Underground poster of a genetically-blessed model in a small yellow bikini, asking: 'Are you beach body ready?' The poster, promoting weight loss, came under fire from some feminists and body image campaigners who branded the campaign body-shaming and called for the offending images to be removed. Transport for London are in the process of removing the ad, and now internet pranksters have hit back with their own version of the poster, this time featuring three curvaceous women and featuring the caption: 'Yes.

The original poster, from Protein World, has been subject to much controversy, with many citing it as 'body-shaming' The spoof advert follows the same striking format as the Protein World original, with an eye-catching yellow background and bold font, and is marked up as a Dove product (Dove's real beauty campaign encourages women to appreciate their bodies, regardless of size and shape) but the brand have denied being involved. After being made aware of the copycat image a representative for Dove said: The ad was not created by Dove but we do believe that every woman is beach body ready! Dove added: 'In 2004, 75% of women felt advertising and media set unrealistic standards of beauty. Today, that figure is 66%, with the perception being that more diversity is portrayed in the images of women we see around us. 'We have clearly made some progress in the 11 years since Dove started Campaign for Real Beauty but there is still much to do. Two thirds of UK women would prefer to see more women of different weights and shapes, different ages and without digital enhancement in the media. This is why Dove will continue to champion beauty for everyone because looking and feeling your best makes you feel happier.' The image, which was posted on the London underground, is now being removed following complaints . Billboards such as this one, were defaced, as a result of anger from body image campaigners and bloggers . It comes as plus-sized fashion label Simply Be also created its own poster. The parody showing model Jocelyn Corona in a bikini is being displayed at London's Knightsbridge Tube station on Saturday. Protesters are planning to gather  to demonstrate against the original poster. Ms Corona said: 'Every woman has the right to feel comfortable in their own skin. I love being able to show off my curves, so it's great to see brands like Simply Be representing real women in the UK.' Simply Be spokesman Ed Watson said that the controversial Protein World advert was 'at best outdated, at worst insulting'. He said: 'While the Protein World model, Renee, is undeniably beautiful and I'm sure very healthy, it is irresponsible to project something that is largely unachievable as the ideal. 'We need to make people feel great about themselves and this poster does the opposite. 'Because it so literally flew in the face of our ethos of self-acceptance, we wanted to get our message out further, hence taking ad space in one of London's busiest tube stations.' The original yellow billboard image received around 270 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), mostly insisting that it objectified women and that it carried the insinuation that only svelte models were ready to go to the beach. The model in the advert, Renee Somerfield, 24, has spoken out about being body-shamed herself . Various posters were subject to defiant vandalism, with uproar sweeping social media. One billboard was pasted over with a piece of paper which read: 'Your body is fine just as it is. Whatever it looks like, your body is not a commodity. #Everybody'sReady #EverydaySexism' Although fitness company Protein World claims that the image is unPhotoshopped, it clearly touched a nerve, with a further 60,000 outraged people signing an online petition on website Change.org asking Protein World to take down the ads. Interestingly, the 24-year-old model in the ad herself, Australian Renee Somerfield has cited the irony of people getting angry about the 'body-shaming' poster, whilst body-shaming her. In an interview with Huffington Post, the model said: 'I am a real person behind the image. I work very hard and live a healthy and active lifestyle which is why Protein World chose me for their campaign. I couldn't work every day as a full time model by starving myself, dieting or not looking after my body. Nourish your body, be kind to it and it will love you right back, no matter your size.'\n",

            "Shocking surveillance footage shows a mob using a hammer, a rocking chair leg and Mace as they beat a homeless man into a coma during a suspected act of revenge. The video taken in the forecourt of the Sunoco gas station on North 5th Street in Philadelphia shows five people, including two children, storming out of a minivan and attacking the helpless 51-year-old. One of the group takes out Mace as the man is brought to the ground. They then stamp on his head and continue punching him as he lies motionless. The encounter is believed to have been caused by a 10-year-old boy telling his mother the homeless man hit him - an allegation police have found no evidence of during their investigation. The video taken in the forecourt of the Sunoco gas station on North 5th Street in Philadelphia shows five people, including two children, storming out of a minivan and attacking the helpless 51-year-old. The encounter is believed to have been caused by a 10-year-old boy telling his mother the homeless man hit him . The youngster accused the man of jockeying with him while asking to fill motorist's tanks for spare change. At the end of the video he is brought out of the car so he can look at the injuries inflicted on the victim, as he lies bloodied on the floor. The boy's mother, 34-year-old Aleathea Gillard, allegedly used the rocking chair leg while close family friend, Shareena Joachim, 24, is said to have carried the Mace. The pair were arrested and charged with attempted murder and related crimes. Lieutenant Dan Brooks of Northwest Detectives said: 'Just watching, you see the viciousness of it.' Police found the minivan outside Einstein Medical Center - where the victim had been taken - shortly after the attack, with Gillard and Joachim inside. Philadelphia police are still looking for the remaining suspects and have asked the public for information. One of the group takes out pepper spray as the man is brought to the ground while another (center) brings a rocking chair leg over . They continue to visciously beat the man as he lies helpless on the ground . Some of the attackers return to the car, but others stamp the motionless man's head . One of the women then brings the boy who accused the man of hitting him over to see the injuries they have inflicted on the man . The boy's mother, 34-year-old Aleathea Gillard (mugshot left), allegedly used the rocking chair leg while close family friend, Shareena Joachim, 24, (mugshot right) is said to have carried the Mace.

            "Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. Etan Patz's 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement .\n",

            "The timing is surely a coincidence – three days before her daughter is due to give birth to another royal baby, Carole Middleton is busy promoting her party firm’s baby-shower goodies. The mother of the Duchess of Cambridge emailed customers of her Party Pieces firm yesterday, recommending the Chevron Divine tablewear range for parents-to-be.

Chevron Divine is just that, and it’s great for a baby shower.’ Scroll down for video . The mother of the Duchess of Cambridge emailed customers of her Party Pieces firm yesterday, re commending the Chevron Divine tablewear range for parents-to-be .

And, in keeping with news that William and Kate do not know the sex of their baby – the fourth in line to the throne, she adds: ‘It teams blue and pink together – perfect if you don’t know what sex the baby is.’ The cheapest item in the range is a £2.79 set of party cups. It also includes straws for £3.49 and cake bunting at £7.69. Mrs Middleton started Party Pieces at home more than 25 years ago and its success has made her a multi-millionaire. But it was criticised for bringing out tacky merchandise for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, such as Corgi-themed scratchcards. However, friends point out that the firm was set up years before the future king began dating Kate, and as head of one of Britain’s leading party goods suppliers Mrs Middleton would not be doing her job if she failed to mark major royal events.

            "A recent college graduate diagnosed with genital herpes is stepping into the limelight in attempt to destigmatize STIs. Ella Dawson, a recent graduate of Wesleyan University who resides in New York City, was diagnosed with herpes two years ago and says she's been dropping the 'herpes bomb' about six months after she had her first outbreak. In her essay for Women's Health Mag, Dawson recalls meeting a boy at a party who offered her a sip of his beer. I have herpes: Ella Dawson has genital herpes and she is sharing her story so that less people with the virus can feel the guilt and shame that sometimes accompanies the common skin condition . 'Don’t worry,' she remembers him saying. 'I don’t have herpes or anything.' His words hit a sore spot for her and she felt compelled to share her sexual health status. '\"That’s funny,’ I said, with as warm a smile as I could manage. ‘Yeah, that’s really funny. Because I have genital herpes.’ His face crumbled. Not because I grossed him out — I could practically see the wheels turning in his brain as he realized he’d made an ignorant joke at someone else’s expense. The guy started apologizing profusely,\"' she wrote in her essay. Dawson said that even though herpes is often the bud of the joke in popular culture, it's a real issue affecting at least one in six Americans. Dawson said that she felt empowered after telling someone she had herpes because it humanized the STI in a way that made it less of a stigma. 'I had seen in the flesh what a simple \"I have herpes\" could do when said fearlessly, without shame,' she wrote. 'Because when a real person — a woman you know and respect — casually mentions having herpes, it stops being a punchline and starts being someone's reality.' Don't strain: Dawson says that people who have herpes should not feel 'dirty or wrong' and should be aware that the virus is manageable and more common than people would expect . According to the CDC about 17 per cent of people ages 14-19 have genital herpes caused by HSV2. That percentage is only of people who choose to get tested and the actual number of people who have the virus is likely much higher. Even having sex with a condom does not protect someone from the highly contagious virus that only needs skin to skin contact to spread, even if there are no sores present. The Washington Post reports that according to an advocacy group called Project Accept Herpes didn't become a stigma until after the 1970s. '[Herpes] was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s,' the group says on their web site. Dr. Peter Anthony Leone, medical director of the North Carolina HIV/STD Prevention and Control Branch told The Washington Post that the stigmatization of the virus was fueled by conservatives after the 'free love era.' Courage: Ella Dawson has the courage to tell people about  her virus because it will humanize the problem for sufferers worldwide . 'Herpes was seen as this marker of being promiscuous or bad or evil,' he said. 'But unless you’re in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has never had sex, you’re at risk.' Leone said that the sex scare campaign was both emotionally traumatizing and also gave false information about the virus. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology conducted in 2011 found several survey respondents with STIs reported feelings like 'less of a person.' Leone said that safe sex is very important but that herpes is not merely a sexual condition but it primarily a skin condition. 'The way you remove stigma is by bringing something to light,' he said. 'We need a push coming at the federal level to talk about sex in terms of health and move away from the disease model. Sex should be seen as part of being an adult, a healthy thing you can do and just part of your routine healthcare.' Dawson told the Washington Post that she will continue to blog about the virus and her dealings with it. She said that ever since her article on herpes was published she has received several emails from people around the world sharing their own story. Don't sit in the dark: Ellas Dawson says that people should communicate openly about herpes since so many people have it .\n",

            "Manuel Pellegrini should be given the chance to turn things around at Manchester City next season, according to Gary Neville. The former Manchester United defender has been critical of Pellegrini's side in recent weeks as the reigning Premier League champions have seen their chances of retaining the crown slip following a dismal run of form and results. But, despite the Chilean being the favourite with many bookmakers to be the next managerial casualty and Jurgen Klopp available in the summer after announcing he is to leave Borussia Dortmund, it is understood City chiefs are not entertaining the idea of replacing Pellegrini at present. Manuel Pellegrini should be 'able to correct the things that have gone wrong', according to Gary Neville . And Neville, talking at a Budweiser Dream Goal event in Regent's Park, believes keeping faith in Pellegrini would bring some much-needed stability to the Etihad Stadium. 'I hope they don't change manager,' Neville said. 'I hope that Manuel Pellegrini stays at Man City and I hope he is able to correct the things that have gone wrong in the last four months. 'He used the term \"garbage\" in recent weeks when discussing City's form and four wins in 15 games for a club like Man City is not right and I hope he stays to correct the performances and can complete the job.' Manchester City were humiliated by rivals United on Sunday as they lost 4-2 at Old Trafford . A 4-2 derby defeat to United last weekend leaves City fourth in the table, with qualification for next season's Champions League not yet assured. Just six wins since the turn of the year has seen the club drop out of the FA Cup to Middlesbrough and come up short against Barcelona in Europe for the second season in succession. Neville feels some work on the side in the summer is required but reckons the type of wholesale changes being suggested may not be the way to go. 'I don't rule anything out - in football you don't make wild predictions,' he said when asked if the current City team will struggle to get back to their best. But Sky Sports pundit Neville  has backed Pellegrini and says only minor changes need to happen this summer . 'These players aren't finished, this team aren't finished. There needs to be some renovation to their house - the people there know that, they don't need me to tell them. 'I have spoken a lot about City over the past months. I have praised them over the last three or four years and rightly so. Some of the football I have seen them play in that time has been the best and their players have been outstanding. 'They have come to a time now where they have dropped below the standard they have set. They have set a standard I have watched, commentated on and been asked to speak about. I have enjoyed when I have watched them. But now, I'm not enjoying watching them.' The Premier League holders sit fourth in the league, 12 points adrift of Chelsea after two straight losses .\n",

            "A prolific gang of thieves who carried out early morning raids on multi-million pound mansions to steal cash, jewellery and luxury cars  have been jailed for a total of 17 years. Mohammed Alam, Sayed Juied and Sadek Miah treated burglary 'like a job, a profession,' raiding houses in affluent west London, Herfordshire and Surrey. Over the course of 11 months the gang broke into 21 homes, taking a Ferrari, Porches, Minis, paintings and cash worth £1million, often waiting until home owners were on holiday before striking. Sayed Juied, 32, and Sadek Miah, 31,  were jailed for six years each after admitting to raiding 21 muti-million pound homes in west London, Hertfordshire and Surrey . The gang were undeterred by security systems, officers said, instead viewing them as a sign a property was worth raiding. If they found that valuables were locked in a safe inside, they would simply cut the safe out, before cracking it open later. Officers first began hunting the group in July last year after a raid on a £2.6million house in Somerset Road, Wimbledon, next door to the Lawn Tennis Association. Mohammed Alam, 26, was give five years. Police said the gang treated robbery as 'a profession', surveying properties before they struck . The raiders smashed in a back window before ransacking the property, taking keys to a £30,000 Porsche Cayenne and a £20,000 Mini Cooper, along with £13,000 of jewellery and electrical items. The house was so badly damaged the owners also had to foot a £13,000 repair bill. A week later the gang struck two neighbouring homesin Putney, including one £4.6million house, taking jewellery worth £38,700, and a Porsche Cayenne worth £75,000. Continuing their all-night burglary spree, they hit another Putney home  where they stole a personalised Ferrari worth £280,000, a matching Cayenne worth £130,000, and a painting worth nearly £50,000. Jewellery worth £8,600 was taken along with £1,400 in foreign notes was taken from a house in Kingston Hill during another raid in July. In another burglary in Kingston Hill last July, the back patio doors were forced open while the homeowners were away and the alarm system was smashed. Jewellery worth £8,600 was taken along with £1,400 in foreign currency. Three homes in Arthur Road, Wimbledon, were targeted between December 2013 and July last year, with damage caused to front doors and property worth £500 taken during one raid. Police tracked the trio after staff at the All England Club, home to the Wimbledon tennis championships, caught their car on CCTV. They passed the details to the Metropolitan Police, who found that the car had been rented by Alam, 26, from Unxbridge, who had used his real name. That in turn led them to Juied, 32, and Miah, 31, both from Maida Vale, west London. When police arrested the trio they found multiple Google searches on their computers on how to disable alarm systems and CCTV, and how to crack open safes. The gang took cars, cash, jewellery, electricals and paintings worth a total of £1million over the course of 11 months. Among their haul were two Porche Cayennes (pictured) worth a total of £205,000 . During one raid at a £2.6million opposite the All England Lawn Tennis Association in Wimbledon, the raiders made off with a £20,000 Mini Cooper (pictured) along with a Porsche, cash and jewels . The gang admitted conspiring to commit the burglaries, and were jailed for a total of 17 years at Kingston Crown Court on Wednesday. Alam was given five years behind bars, while Juied and Miah were both given six-year prison terms. Detective Sergeant Dan Mitchell, from Merton burglary team, said: 'They would conduct reconnaissance on big detached houses in really affluent neighbourhoods and then break in. 'They were quite an unusual team, they were not deterred at all by CCTV and alarm systems, that's how they thought somewhere was a worthwhile target. 'They would smash the alarm box as soon as they got in. They would go straight for the safe and try and take the whole safe out, the main thing they wanted was cash. 'They were treating it as a job, a profession. They're the most professional team I have worked on.'\n",

            "Quarter of a century after his last number one, Paul Simon is back at the top of the charts. The 73-year-old - who rose to fame as part of Simon & Garfunkel - has forged ahead of more youthful musicians to reach number one in the UK album chart with The Ultimate Collection. His album outsold those by the likes of Ed Sheeran, James Bay and Sam Smith. Number one: Paul Simon topped the UK albums chart for the first time in 25 years. His latest release, The Ultimate Collection, beat albums from more youthful musicians such as Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith . Simon's recent tour with Sting (left) is believed to have been the catalyst in helping to propel him to the top of the charts. It is the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990 . The greatest hits record includes 19 tracks from Simon’s 50-year career, including Mrs Robinson and The Only Living Boy in New York, from his days recording and performing as Simon & Garfunkel with Art Garfunkel, prior to their break up in the 1970s, and some of his solo hits such as 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover. It marks a return to popularity for the Grammy Award-winning singer, 73, as the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990. Simon is currently on his On Stage Together world tour with Sting. It is thought the success of the pair’s live shows, which have been met with rave reviews, is what propelled the album to number one. Simon & Garfunkel broke up spectacularly, and very publicly, in 1970, soon after the release of their album Bridge Over Troubled Water. Early success: The 73-year-old rose to fame as one half of Simon and Garfunkel. He and Art Garfunkel (left) broke up in 1970 soon after the release of their album Bridge Over Troubled Water .\n",

            "Carwyn Scott-Howell's death was a tragic accident, according to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau . The family of tragic ski boy Carwyn Scott-Howell were expected to bring his body home this weekend as an investigation into his death ruled out negligence as a factor. Carwyn, seven, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France, while skiing with his mother Ceri and siblings Gerwyn and Antonia, after becoming separated from them. According to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau, the schoolboy’s death earlier this month was ‘a tragic accident’ with no one to blame. The family, from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, were enjoying their last run of the holiday when Antonia fell and her mother stopped to help. Carwyn carried on skiing and then ventured into a wooded area. His mother thought he had continued to their accommodation but raised the alarm when he did not return. Mr Michau said: ‘The inquiry has found the piste was well signposted. The boy would have been aware that he was leaving the piste. The reason why is not known but it was by error. ‘Had he been with someone bigger or older, the accident wouldn’t have happened but it remains a dramatic and tragic accident.’ In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. 'Carwyn was a very competent skier and snowboarder who had started skiing at the age of three and spent several weeks each year skiing. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day. 'The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead,' it said. 'The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts. ' Carwyn, seven,  from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France .\n",

            "Despite Arsenal winning their eighth Premier League game in a row on Saturday, the club's chief executive Ivan Gazidis says he is 'not happy' that the club are not going to win the title. With top spot set to elude Arsenal again, Gazidis says the club will 'keep pushing' Chelsea, but he admitted winning the championship is unlikely. And Gazidis fears Arsenal will find it harder in future just to maintain their perennial place in the top four Champions League qualification places due to a surge in television cash. Aaron Ramsey smashes the ball home in the win over Burnley, Arsenal's eighth victory in a row in the league . Francis Coquelin wins the ball off George Boyd as the Gunners moved four points clear in second place . Gazidis says the Premier League is 'going to become more competitive which is going to be more challenging for clubs like us.' The Gunners haven't won the league since 2004 and their first eight-game winning run since then has propelled them to second. Earlier setbacks, though, for Arsene Wenger's team helped Chelsea to establish a commanding lead. 'we are not happy but we are going to keep pushing to the end and see how far we can go,' said Gazidis. Ivan Gazidis says he is not happy with second place, and says the club may struggle in the near future .\n",

            "(CNN)The shootings' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed. Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance. So what's changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend? And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incident? It's tough to say for sure, but here are some of the stark differences in the cases, the lessons learned by both police and the public, and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future. Ferguson: Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson's gun, and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was, where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer. North Charleston: Though it's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone, it's 100% clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran away. Takeaway: Where Brown's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the Scott shooting. It would be tough to extrapolate for certain, but it's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer, and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilson's fate dragged on for months. Ferguson: Black residents outnumber whites in the St. Louis suburb by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, yet at the time of Brown's shooting, there were only three black officers on the city's 53-member force, and there was only one African-American member of the six-member City Council. (Two more African-Americans were voted in during this week's city's elections.) North Charleston: It's closer to an even split here, with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's police department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of the 10 City Council members are black. Takeaway: The ratio of white and black officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Ferguson Police Department, but both are considerably off. As for the city councils, the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North Charleston's. But before you place too much emphasis on the percentages, there are other variables to consider, like policing methods, as CNN political commentator Marc Lamont Hill pointed out. Changing the racial makeup of a department alone won't do the trick if officers aren't taught the best practices. \"Black people didn't march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us,\" he said. \"I want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly. We need community-based policing if we're going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods.\" Ferguson: There was no bystander video of Michael Brown's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired. North Charleston: It's unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness Feidin Santana. Even North Charleston's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott's shooting. Not only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he's running away, it also shows him placing a dark-colored object next to Scott's lifeless body. That could be significant, because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser and he feared for his life. But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scott's body was actually the Taser, Slager could be accused of planting evidence. The takeaway: Ferguson resident Alexis Templeton said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves. The video of the North Charleston shooting, she said, is vital. \"If there is no video, folks don't believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country,\" she said. \"But with a video, you can't say it's not happening.\" Ferguson: The largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were marred by looting, arson and even shootings. Violence erupted again in November after Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, wasn't indicted. And even after Ferguson's police chief resigned last month, two officers were shot during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department. North Charleston: After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful so far. The takeaway: Some Ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way North Charleston is handling its own tragedy. Lee Smith, who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a Ferguson City Council seat, said he was glad to see authorities in South Carolina charge Slager with murder. \"I am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in Ferguson,\" Smith said. Ferguson: It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, then-police chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Brown's family. And rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer. North Charleston: Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday, two days after Santana shared his video with Scott's family. Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a \"bad decision.\" Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scott's family. \"When you're wrong, you're wrong,\" he said. \"And if you make a bad decision -- don't care if you're behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision.\" The takeaway: Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced others. \"I think these situations are given much more scrutiny now,\" said Fletcher, who won a seat on Ferguson's city council this week. \"They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson. Every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do.\" Ferguson: After Brown's death in August, many asked why Wilson didn't have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels. Three months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers. North Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. But after the shooting, the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said. The takeaway: Not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras. Some police unions have scoffed at the idea, and the American Civil Liberties Union has cited privacy concerns. They're also expensive. Several camera models cost at least $500 each, and storing all that footage can cost as much as $20,000 a year. But National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public, but also police. \"I think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis, it's going to protect good officers who do the right thing,\" Morial said. \"But it's also going to ferret out, if you will, bad actions by bad officers.\" CNN's Moni Basu, Gregory Wallace and Wolf Blitzer contributed to the report.\n",

            "Wellness warrior Belle Gibson sensationally admitted yesterday in a tell-all interview that she had made up her terminal brain cancer diagnosis. The 23-year-old founder of The Whole Pantry app came clean about her circumstances, telling the Australian Women's Weekly, 'none of it's true'. In the interview, Gibson asked her former fans and customers who purchased her app and books to see her as only 'human'. Leading psychologist Jo Lamble told Daily Mail Australia that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders. Scroll down for video . Life-long struggle with the truth: Belle Gibson sensationally admitted that her terminal cancer was a lie in an interview with the Australian Women's Weekly . Lamble has not treated Gibson personally but said, in her professional opinion, she believes Gibson could be displaying signs of both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lack of remorse is a common trait seen in those with anti-social personalities, Lamble says. 'A lack of remorse definitely fits in. It's like - you do what you need to do to get what you want,' she said. 'So if they need money they will commit fraudulent acts and steal, for example.' While other experts suggested to AWW that she could be suffering Munchhausen Syndrome, Lamble believes this isn't likely to be the case for Gibson. Changing times: 'In the past, a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand,' says Lamble . 'With Munchhausen, they normally don’t just lie, they go much further to be sick. 'While they definitely fake illness, they also self-harm and don’t normally do it for money purposes, they do it for attention,' she said. 'For example, they will go to lots of different doctors and shop around until someone believes their symptoms. They also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves, then ask, \"what’s wrong with me?'' 'So I think in this particular case,  she’s made up a story for fame, fortune, signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism,' added Lamble. Another common trait shared by narcissists is that sufferers are often very charismatic. 'A lack or remorse definitely fits in... you do want you need to do to get what you want': Leading psychologist Jo Lamble says that Gibson's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder . 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune. They love to believe they are special and need all this admiration and attention,' the psychologist said. Lamble says this can often be a sign of neglect. This fits with Gibson's account of a troubled childhood - she was quoted in the Women's Weekly saying she had to bring herself up - doing the dishes and cooking her own food from a very young age, for example. According to Lamble, the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are... 1. They deceive and lie . 2. They lack remorse . 3. They can be  impulsive and irresponsible . 4. They don’t respect the law . 5. They don’t mind if they hurt family and friends, anyone is open to being deceived . 6. They are very charming and charismatic . 7. They have a certain attractiveness and draw people in . 8. They show a real interest in people . 9. Passionate about things . 'Neglect can lead someone to develop really unhealthy strategies to seek the love and attention they missed out on,' says Lamble. 'In the past, a need for love and attention may have emerged in less dangerous ways  - a lie here, a lie there - but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand. 'Social media has become the perfect way to gain that, we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers -  let alone hero worship, worldwide fans and book deals,' she said. 'I worry about future generations with things like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and people constantly needing excessive praise.' Lamble says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading. 'Everyone laughs about Dr Google and how if you have some condition you should see an expert but that goes for all these self styled gurus in anything. 'We might want to buy into a story, it's very appealing for people to love somebody who can turn something around and survive and particularly so if they are very marketable but any idolisation of someone isn't healthy. 'With massive followings and a glamorous story, young minds will follow that and believe it. Our poor doctors must have people coming in every day and people saying this is what I'm doing and why. Let’s look at the science,' she said. 'They love to believe they are special': 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune, says psychologist Jo Lamble (pictured left). She believes Belle Gibson (pictured right) may suffer from a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lamble also believes that Gibson could struggle to change without help. 'She might change her name and come up with some other scheme unless she shows genuine remorse, seeks help, and develops some insight. With what she is displaying, the prognosis is quite poor.' According to the interview, Gibson's new management will be organising for a psychologist to see her.\n",

            "A bloody and wounded shop owner has been pictured just moments before he died from his injuries on another day of xenophobic attacks in South Africa. The man who is believed to be from Mozambique was taken to a hospital in Johannesburg where he tragically passed away. At least six people have been killed and many thousands displaced from their homes since the violence against immigrants erupted in the city of Durban several weeks ago. Despite making 30 arrests overnight, police are struggling to subdue the machete-wielding gangs who ransacked immigrant-owned shops in the slums of Johannesburg. Many families in the city who now fear for their lives have abandoned their homes and fled to a makeshift refugee camp which lies just east of Johannesburg. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has called for an end to the 'shocking and unacceptable' attacks on immigrants from Africa and South Asia, saying: 'No amount of frustration and anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals.' Scroll down for video . Victim: A shop owner believed to be from Mozambique (pictured) has died from his injuries amid the xenophobic violence that has gripped South Africa . Wounded: Bloodied and hurt, the man was taken to a hospital in Johannesburg where he eventually died . Help: A passer-by comes to the aid of the shop owner who was fatally attacked in poor area of Johannesburg and later died in hospital . Dying: He is one of at least six who have been killed in the country this week as armed gangs target foreigners in a spate of xenophobic attacks . Looted: A woman sifts through the remains of the ransacked store she was renting to foreign nationals who are now being targeted by violent groups in Johannesburg . Attacks: At least six people have been killed and many thousands displaced from their homes since the violence against immigrants erupted in the city of Durban several weeks ago . Violent: Gangs of anti-immigrant protesters armed with hammers, knives and machetes have been reeking havoc in South Africa . Scorched: 12 people were arrested overnight as anti-foreigner attacks in South Africa spread to parts of  Johannesburg where rioters torched tires (pictured) Dangerous: Despite making 30 arrests overnight, police have struggled to control the gangs who have torched cars and shops owned by foreign nationals . Refugee: This child who awaits much-needed hospital treatment is one of dozens whose family has been forced to abandon their homes in Johannesburg for a makeshift camp in the city . Protection: Foreign nationals who fear for their lives have gathered at a relief camp (pictured) set up in Primrose, East of Johannesburg . Innocence lost: One of the many refugees now seeking shelter in Johannesburg is two-year-old toddler Knowledge (pictured) Pain: One man needed emergency treatment for his injuries at the refugee camp set up for foreign nationals fleeing attacks from South Africans . Victims: South African President Jacob Zuma has said the majority foreign nationals (pictured) being targeted by angry, armed mobs are living in the country legally and contribute to its economy . Anger: Zuma has called for an end to the 'shocking and unacceptable' attacks on immigrants from Africa, some of whom now occupy a refugee camp east of Johannesburg (pictured) Homeless: Some South Africans blame immigrants coming to the country (pictured) of taking jobs and opportunities away from them . Justification: But South African President Zuma has said 'no amount of frustration and anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals' There was a heavy police presence in the Alexandra township as armed rioters looted shops, burned tires and built street barricades overnight. And armed policeman fired rubber bullets at the groups who have torched shops and cars in the poor areas of Johannesburg in recent days. Police claim that attacks on immigrants - many of whom are from other African countries - have largely subsided in the country's east where the violence began. With unemployment and poverty levels high in the country, some South Africans have accused the immigrants of taking jobs and opportunities away from them. A police spokesman said the 30 people arrested in Johannesburg overnight will be charged for 'public violence, malicious damage to property, house breaking and theft'. Thousands of foreigners in the country have fled their homes and the country amid the violence, escaping to makeshift camps as well as neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique. The surge of violence against immigrants is widely blamed on a speech made by King Goodwill Zwelithini, a traditional Zulu leader who blamed the foreigners living South Africa for its high crime rate and said they must 'take their bags and go'. He has been accused of 'igniting' the Zulus who comprise one of South Africa's largest ethnic groups by saying 'we must deal with our own lice' in a speech broadcast by a local radio station. The King has since said his words were misinterpreted but for some, Zwelithini simply articulated what many were feeling. Protest: South African demonstrators have taken to the streets in Johannesburg in a bid to raise awareness of the xenophobic attacks taking place in its township . Furious: And in neighbouring Mozambique, hundreds have been protesting the violence being inflicted on their countrymen in South Africa . Safety: As people in Maputo, Mozambique (pictured) protest against the violence in South Africa, its government has offered to evacuate its citizens from the country . Rise up: Mozambique nationals (pictured) are furious at the violence against their citizens in Johannesburg were four people were killed in a week where shops owned by foreigners were looted back in January . Blame: Protesters in Mozambique (pictured) hold up signs blaming South African President Jacob Zuma for the violence befalling immigrants in the country . Demonstrators: Some South Africans (pictured) have tried to raise awareness for the xenophobic violence but some blame the immigrants for taking jobs in a time of severe unemployment . Armed: At least six people have died since South Africans wielding machetes and other weapons (pictured) began attacking and looting properties owned by fellow Africans . Brutal: The surge of violence against immigrants is widely blamed on a speech made by a traditional Zulu leader who blamed foreigners for a rise in hate crime . Response: Police in Johannesburg (pictured) have been firing rubber bullets to subdue the violent gangs in the city . Battle: A South African police officer trains his sights on Zulu protesters who were demonstrated in front of their hostel in the Jeppestown district of Johannesburg (pictured) Retaliation: But police also claim that attacks on immigrants - many of whom are from other African countries - have largely subsided . The violence has also been blamed on high unemployment and while recent figures put it at 25 per cent, economists believe it is much higher and crippling the country with widespread poverty and a glaring class divide. Meanwhile foreign nationals have condemned South Africa's police for failing to protect them and even stirring hostility. The government says it is addressing complaints about undocumented migrants but many foreign nationals are living legally in South Africa and contributing to economic development. But the situation has become so severe that the government of Malawi has hired buses to repatriate 500 of its nationals, according to the country's Information Minister. Kenya has also offered to evacuate any of their citizens who feel threatened and on just today, Mozambique has temporarily blocked a road leading to South Africa. 60 people died during similar unrest in the country in 2008 and in January this year, four people were killed in a week where shops owned by foreigners were looted in Soweto, Johannesburg. Furious: A terrifying woman covered in black soot (pictured) began screaming at a group of foreign nationals in Johannesburg . Savage: Rioters have armed themselves with sticks, knives and baseball bats as they attack immigrants in Johannesburg (pictured) Rioters: The violence in South Africa has also been blamed on high unemployment and a glaring class divide . Vicious: With a total population of about 50 million, South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants who are now being targeted by brutal gangs (pictured) Zimbabwe's Information Minster Jonathan Moyo tweeted that 'xenophobia today can easily mutate into genocide tomorrow' adding that  the Zulu king should 'extinguish what he ignited'. While in Somalia's capital of Mogadishu, some locals believed their countrymen would have been safer in their troubled native country than in South Africa. One resident of the city said: 'This must become a lesson for them to return home... Otherwise, they will be eliminated one by one.\" It is also a major destination for asylum seekers and currently houses more than 300,000 of them according to projections by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. With a total population of about 50 million, South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants from countries including Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Malawi.\n",

            "Rita Wilson appears with an ensemble of actresses in a satirical new video promoting gender equality which ironically proclaims: 'It's only fair that men should have it all.' The clip, which was created by the Make it Fair Project, presents a string of statistics that highlight the disproportionate presence that men have in influential industries like Hollywood, which means that, more often than not, males hold 70 to 95 per cent of the industry’s most important positions. 'We won't relent 'til it's 100 per cent,' the women sing in a tongue-in-cheek refrain that repeats throughout the PSA. Scroll down for video . Poor guys: Rita Wilson pretends to be sad that men don't completely dominate film industry in a new gender-equality PSA by the Make it Fair Project . 'In the past three years, only 93 per cent of films were directed by men, and only 80 per cent were written by them,' the actresses, including Meryl Streep’s actress daughter Mamie Gummer, say at the beginning of the video. They go on to note, completely dead-pan, that in 2014, 'only' 88 per cent of box office hits featured a man in the leading role. 'Sadly', they say, 'only' 70 per cent of speaking roles in films are also given to men, and women 'get to be naked' in movies twice as often as men do. The problem exists even on the Broadway stage, they point out, with 13 out of 13 plays last year being written by men. Speaking up: Actress Mamie Gummer (pictured, in a photograph by Nadia Quinn) sings in the video that it's 'only fair that men should have it all', not just 80 or 90 per cent of an industry . Far-reaching issue: Though the actresses highlight gender inequality in Hollywood, they also point out similar problems in government and Fortune 500 companies . Rita, who is known for her roles in Sleepless in Seattle and Runaway Bride, looks distressed as she lists the unfavorable statistics. The video comes just weeks after Rita revealed her battle with cancer and double mastectomy. Now, the actress, who has had devoted husband Tom Hanks by her side, is making more headlines for speaking out about another issue that effects women, this time in the film industry. But while these actresses have a particular interest in Hollywood's status quo, they insist that 'showbiz' isn't the only place where there is startling gender inequality. 'Men make up only 88 per cent of Congress, 80 per cent of governors, 95 per cent of Fortune 500 CEOs, [and] 97 per cent of creative directors in advertising,' they continue. No laughing matter: The cast of actresses sing and clap in an imitation of musical numbers performed during more serious telethons and PSAs . Social savvy: The creators of the project are promoting their message on social media with the hashtag #MakeItFair . Making a point: The YoutTube video was created by an all-female crew to demonstrate the range of talented women available . The women also point out that men continue to hold the top roles in big industries and get paid 30 per cent more than women despite the fact that women make up almost 60 per cent of college graduates. The group wraps up with a rousing telethon-style musical number, singing together: 'We stand here together, and together we'll break down this wall.' These numbers impact everything, the video explains: 'The stories we tell, the wages we earn, the future we shape.' For their part, the creators of the video worked with an all-female team: The PSA is completely written, produced, and starred in my women, a fact that the project says underscores 'the wealth of female talent that often goes untapped'.\n",

            "For U.S. moms, the typical time between pregnancies is about 2½ years but nearly a third of women space their children too close, a government study shows. Experts say mothers should wait at least 18 months to give their body time to recover and increase the chances the next child is full-term and healthy. The study released on Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 30 percent of women who'd had a child became pregnant again within 18 months. Dangerous pregnancy: The study released on Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 30 percent of women who'd had a child became pregnant again within 18 months . Second baby: For U.S. moms, the typical time between pregnancies is about 2½ years but nearly a third of women space their children too close, a government study shows . 'That is actually pretty high and very problematic,' said Heike Thiel de Bocanegra, a reproductive health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. She was not involved in the new study. The report is based on 2011 birth certificates from 36 states and the District of Columbia, representing about 83 percent of the nation's births that year. It was the first such report by the CDC so researchers don't know if pregnancy spacing has changed over time. The study found that the median time to next pregnancy was 2 years, 5 months. About half fell in the 18 months to 5 year range. About 20 percent had babies more than 5 years apart. White women had the shortest spacing — about 2 years, 2 months on average. Black and Hispanic women typically waited 2½ years or longer. The older the mom was, the longer the spacing between a birth and her next pregnancy. Data: The report is based on 2011 birth certificates from 36 states and the District of Columbia, representing about 83 percent of the nation's births that year . Of course, miscarriages, illnesses or other factors can affect a couple's plans. Lhamo Ellin of New York had her daughter about 12 years after her son. 'I tried. It didn't happen,' said Ellin. She works as a nanny in a Brooklyn neighborhood that is a magnet for young families, where she said siblings seemed to be about three to five years apart.

Goldberg, who is only about a year younger than his brother, agreed with the experts. 'Second kid suffers. A lot runtier. He was like double my size when I was younger,' he said.

            "Radio DJ Neil Fox forced himself on a girl of 13 at a theme park after she asked him to pose for a photo, it was alleged yesterday. Fox – known to his millions of listeners as Dr Fox – also indecently assaulted two star-struck girls under the age of 16 at a motor show, a court heard. The 53-year-old is accused of a total of nine offences against three girls and three women over 23 years. One alleged victim says Fox repeatedly assaulted her at Capital Radio’s studios in Leicester Square. Scroll down for video . Support: DJ 'Dr' Neil Fox leaves court with his wife Vicky where he denied nine sex attacks on six victims - including three children . Two others say they were sexually touched against their will by him at Magic FM’s studios in Central London. Fox denies seven counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual touching without consent against six females between 1991 and 2014. As the charges were put at Westminster Magistrates Court, his barrister Jonathan Caplan QC asked for reporting restrictions to be lifted because there had been false statements about the charges on social media. Fox, who wore a dark pinstripe suit and was accompanied to court by his wife Vicky, asked for his case to be heard by a district judge at the court, rather than facing a jury trial. Prosecutor Darren Watts told the court: ‘The Crown argue that the complaints show a consistent and determined pattern of sexual predatory behaviour.’ He said Fox, a former Pop Idol judge, allegedly assaulted two girls at a motor show in Bromley, South East London, in the summer of 1991 while appearing there as a DJ. Mr Watts said: ‘In relation to the first allegation the complainant was approximately 13 or 14 years of age. She... asked for a photograph with him and he is said to have kissed her and forced his tongue down into her mouth.’ Fox, who denies sex attacks on women and children, smiles after he left today's hearing . A second teenager alleged Fox kissed her and put his hand up her skirt. The attack on the 13-year-old girl at Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey took place in 1996 and allegedly involved Fox forcing his tongue into her mouth after she asked for a photo. He faces four charges of indecent assault against a former female colleague at Capital Radio, where he worked from 1993 to 2005. The woman claims he squeezed her breasts and would regularly grope her bottom. Fox, of Chelsea, was granted bail and is next due in court on April 30. Fox was first arrested in September last year and the DJ, who categorically denies the allegations, was then questioned for more than seven hours over four alleged offences. At the same time, officers swooped on his £3million home. Darren Watts, prosecuting said: 'In relation to the second allegation the victim was approximately 15, at the same motor show. 'The defendant was present and has again been asked for a photograph, and it is alleged he kissed her - forcing his tongue into her mouth while putting his hand up her skirt and touching her bottom. Mr Watts explained that the next four allegations related to the same victim, a woman over 16 years old, at Capital Radio between 31 January 2003 and 31 December 2003. 'In four separate incidents he has shown unacceptable behaviour,' Mr Watts said. 'The first time he has put his arms around her, squeezing her breasts tightly. 'He would regularly touch her bottom, be that a caress or a squeeze. 'The third incident happened while he was in the recording studio - he bent her over from behind and stimulated sex.' Mr Watts said on the fourth occasion Fox had touched the woman between her legs, albeit over clothing. Defence: Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, said he 'categorically denies' the allegations . The final two allegations of inappropriate touching are said to have taken place at Magic FM between January and November 2007, and March and August 2014. 'The next incident (eighth allegation) happened in the work place,' Mr Watts said. 'It is said the defendant started touching her and putting his hand up her top, exposing her bra and breast.' Suspended: Dr Fox is one of Britain's most famous DJs but has been unable to work since his arrest . Fox then allegedly pushed her onto a sofa and simulated having sex, the court heard. The final incident also took place at Magic, where Fox is said to have approached a woman from behind and said 'Oh, I have just got to,' before kissing her on the shoulder. He allegedly said to her: 'You look as if you taste so good.' Charge one: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14 years in Bromley in 1991 . Charge two: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 16 years in Bromley in 1991 . Charge three: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 16 years at Chessington World of Adventures in 1996 . Charge four: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge five: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge six: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge seven: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge eight: Sexual assault on a female in 2007 in central London . Charge nine:Sexual assault on a female in 2014 in central London . Mr Caplan said it was 'regrettable' that he had to apply for reporting restrictions to be lifted, but qualified he was doing this to ensure a 'fair trial' for his client. Mr Caplan added that misreporting in the press and on social media as to what the allegations and charges amount to  had 'courted inferences' about the allegations which were 'wholly wrong.' He said the alleged offences amounted to 'inappropriate kissing and touching over clothing.' Mr Fox, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon. The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival. He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans. Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career. But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade. Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.

            "A newborn baby girl abandoned in an amusement arcade was found face down in a toilet bowl after her 'mother gave birth in the lavatory', it has been revealed. It is believed the girl, named April by staff at the Ormskirk hospital where she is being treated, might have been delivered at Silcock's Amusement Arcade in Nevill Street, Southport, hours before she was discovered. Merseyside Police had released an image of the 6lb 9oz baby girl, wearing a pink playsuit, as they sought to identify her mother. In a statement yesterday afternoon, officers said they had traced the mother to an address in the Merseyside area. Scroll down for video . Officers say they have found the mother of baby April (pictured). Sniffer dogs had been deployed in the area after the discovery in the disabled toilets of an arcade . Police earlier released a CCTV image of a woman they were looking to trace after a newborn baby was found at Silcock’s Amusement Arcade, on Neville Street, Southport last night . Amusement arcade employee Christina Hodskinson found baby April when a colleague said the toilets needed cleaning. She was quickly joined by fellow worker Warren Chadwick who came to help . Police believe April may have been 'born where she was found', Sky reported today. She was just hours old when she was discovered. Staff at the amusement arcade earlier spoke of the moment the baby was whisked from the toilet bowl when a father's paternal instincts kicked in. Christina Hodskinson, 44, discovered the newborn, who has since been named baby April by hospital staff, after a colleague said the toilets needed cleaning. She was quickly joined by fellow employee Warren Chadwick, 36, who Ms Hodskinson said 'grabbed the baby out of the toilet'. Mr Chadwick, who works at Silcock’s Amusement Arcade, on Neville Street, Southport where the baby was found at around 6.50pm yesterday, told how his paternal instinct kicked in immediately. He said: 'I saw the baby and it was just instant, I grabbed her out and patted her back and she started to cry. 'Some customers got some towels and we wrapped her up and stood under the heaters. 'The police got here really quickly, I sat with her in the police car to keep her warm and then we rushed straight to hospital.

            "The second in command at the sheriff's department where reserve deputy accidentally killed a man because he fired his gun instead of a Taser has resigned. Undersheriff Tim Albin, of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, quit his job Monday after new revelations about how the department treated elderly killer Robert Bates, 73. Bates, who was a volunteer deputy, shot dead Eric Harris, 44, after he was tackled to the ground. Video of the killing shows Bates exclaiming that he opened fired by accident, and apologizing. Resignation: Undersheriff Tim Albin (pictured), of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, quit his job Monday after new revelations about how the department treated elderly killer, reserve deputy Robert Bates . In the tide of scrutiny which followed the incident, it emerged that other deputies in the department had expressed concern about his fitness to serve, but were told to hold their tongues. Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had made substantial donations to the department in previous years. He has been charged with manslaughter - but a judge allowed him to take a month-long holiday to the Bahamas before his day in court. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify why Undersheriff Tim Albin stepped down, but said departmental reorganization was necessary following the April 2 shooting. Charged: Bates, 73, (left) accidentally grabbed his pistol and killed Eric Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) in what he said was an accident . 'Given the gravity of the current situation and the need to go a different direction with our leadership and management he agrees with me that it is time for a change,' Glanz wrote in a news release. Albin, who has been in his position for 26 years, has yet to comment on his departure, which will take effect and the end of this week. Albin was named in a 2009 internal investigation released Friday that showed deputies had expressed concerns about Bates' performance. Some claimed Albin gave Bates preferential treatment and intimidated those who raised concerns. The former head of the reserve deputy program, Sergeant Randy Chapman, told the investigator that Albin chastised him after he questioned Bates' performance. Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . 'You need to stop messing with (Bates) because he does a lot of good for the County,' Chapman is quoted in the memo saying Albin told him that. Chapman declined to talk about the memo when contacted last week by The Associated Press and also declined Monday after Albin's resignation. 'I've been told to stay out of it,' he said. According to the report, Chapman complained to Albin on one occasion that Bates was driving a personal car with police equipment prior to having the requisite training, Albin told him: 'This is a s--- sandwich and you will just have to eat it but not acquire a taste for it.' A little more than five years later, 44-year-old Eric Harris was shot while on the ground in custody after running from deputies following a sting operation. The 73-year-old Bates has pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree manslaughter. Bates is white and Harris was black, but the victim's brother has said he doesn't believe the shooting was racially motivated. Attorneys for Harris' family have repeatedly called on Glanz and Albin to resign.\n",

People in these three countries have an excuse – they spend less time in bed, with the Japanese getting an hour and a half less sleep. Scroll down for video . Moody mornings: Brits wake up grumpier than anyone else in the Western world, according to users of a sleep app... despite getting more time in bed than most other nations – seven hours 22 minutes a night . But while we might sleep longer, we don’t feel as refreshed in the morning, according to results from users of the Sleep Cycle app. The app tracks how well people rest at night by using the motion sensor in their smartphone. The app then comes up with a ‘sleep score’ for the user. By looking at results from 944,000 people, including 75,000 from the UK, researchers found the British had the seventh most disturbed sleep out of 50 countries surveyed. And our mood on waking – determined by users tapping a ‘happy’, ‘sad’ or ‘in-between’ face – was fourth worst, even though we spend more time in bed than anyone bar the Finns (7hrs 23mins), Dutch (7hrs 24mins) and New Zealanders (7hrs 27mins). But sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley questioned the accuracy of such apps because they assume you are asleep if you are still, which is not always the case.

            "A resurgent Kimi Raikkonen sees no reason why Ferrari cannot win this year's Formula One world title race. Following a torrid campaign with the team in 2014, Raikkonen finally has a car to his liking at Ferrari this season, with the Finn looking far more like his old competitive self. Only qualifying issues have denied Raikkonen better results so far this term, with the 35-year-old knocking on the door of his first podium place for 19 months after finishing fourth in the last two races. Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth at the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday . Ferrari have proved more competitive in the first three races of this season than they were last year . At the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday, Raikkonen was reeling in team-mate Sebastian Vettel and may well have claimed third but for a late safety car. Although Vettel and Raikkonen were comfortably adrift of Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at that stage, the Finn is confident Ferrari can catch and regularly beat their German rivals. 'I don't see a reason why not,' said Raikkonen. 'We have made big gains and we will continue to make big gains during this year. 'Obviously everybody will improve, so it depends what the rest are doing, but we are definitely going the right way and doing the right things. 'It is about being patient. We need time, we cannot make miracles overnight. Sebastian Vettel finished on the podium for the third time this season at the Chinese Grand Prix . 'Sebastian showed we can win (in Malaysia last month), but it depends as one circuit may be better for one team and the next could be a different story. 'We just need to be up there when something happens to them, or the conditions change, but I really feel on speed we will get there to regularly beat them.' Raikkonen recognises, though, he needs to do better in qualifying on Saturday if he is to thrust himself into the hunt for the title. An error at the Shanghai International Circuit resulted in Raikkonen starting sixth, and although he passed Williams duo Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa on lap one, he could do no more. Raikkonen sees no reason why Ferrari cannot challenge for the title this season . 'After my mistake fourth was more or less maximum,' added Raikkonen. 'I probably could have tried (to pass Vettel) at least, but there was a safety car at the end. It is what it is. 'After what happened on Saturday we at least gained some positions and we had a pretty good car. 'But we are not happy. We have to make Saturdays more correct as it gives you bigger chances and an easier life in the race. 'It doesn't help when you put yourself in a more difficult position for the race, especially one where it is never easy to overtake.'\n",

            "Juventus have ruled out a move for Manchester United loan star Radamel Falcao after claiming the Colombia striker's wages are 'beyond their means'. Falcao has endured a difficult period at Old Trafford after arriving in an expensive loan deal from Monaco last summer. The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him. Radamel Falcao (right) has scored only four goals since arriving at Manchester United from Monaco . The Colombian is expected to leave in the summer, although Juventus claim they cannot afford him . 'Falcao is a Monaco player on loan at Manchester United and his wages are substantial and beyond our means,' Marotta told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'It's utopian to imagine him in a Juventus shirt.' However, Marotta did claim the Italians, who reached the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Monaco on Wednesday, were interested in strike pair Paulo Dybala and Edinson Cavani. With former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez set to return to Boca Juniors at the end of the season, Juventus need to reinforce their forward line with Palermo's Dybala and Edinson of Paris Saint Germain at the top of their wishlist. The Serie A champions have expressed an interest in highly rated Palermo youngster Paulo Dybala . With Dybala rated at £35m, PSG's unsettled striker Edinson Cavani could be a cheaper alternative . 'We do like Dybala and he is one of our objectives,' Marotta said. 'I won't hide the fact that I have met with [Palermo president Maurizio] Zamparini -- even if I do go and deny it, he will only blurt it out anyway. 'He's a great player, but alongside him you need experienced players too. We're trying to find an agreement with Zamparini for this player who we like, but we're not the only ones who like him. Let's just see what happens.' Juventus players celebrate after beating Monaco to reach the Champions League semi-finals . The 21-year-old, who has scored 13 goals this term, is rated at £35million by his club - a fee that the Old Lady would not be prepared to meet, leading Marotta to also express his interest in Uruguay forward Cavani. 'We've not had any contact with Paris Saint-Germain for Cavani, but if he were to be placed on the market, then we would have a little chat,' Marotta said.\n",

            "Palmerston remains a very painful place for Rangers managers. Consider this the first harsh lesson of Stuart McCall’s tenure. Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall’s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after an own goal doubles Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . Gavin Reilly (left) celebrates after forcing an own goal for  QOTS's third to dent Rangers' second place hopes . Queen of the South: Clark, Durnan (Hooper), Dowie, Higgins, Kidd, McShane, Carmichael, McKenna, Holt, Lyle (Pickard), Reilly (Russell) Subs: Paton, Atkinson, Smith, Smith . Booked: Higgins . Scorers: Lyle 33', Wallace (og) 46', Reilly 69' Rangers: Robinson, McGregor, Zaliukas, Mohsni, Wallace, Templeton (Crawford), Law, Murdoch, Vuckic, Miller (Hardie), Clark (Boyd) Subs: Black, Shiels, Simonsen, Sinnamon . Booked: Templeton, Moshni . Ref: Don Robertson . Att: 5,093 . Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler’s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by QOTS' Chris Higgins . New manager Stuart McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Rangers were without suspended skipper Lee McCulloch – banned after a red card for an elbow on Hearts’ Osman Sow at the weekend – which meant a starting role for Bilel Mohsni alongside Marius Zaliukas at the heart of the defence. There was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges, as the game developed at a rather sedate pace. McCall watched it unfold pensively. Clearly, what he was seeing wasn’t to his liking. His side did have flickers of threat early on, but they often owed much to fortune. Andy Murdoch saw a mis-hit cross clawed out by Zander Clark, before a similar delivery from David Templeton looped fractionally over. The winger was another change to McCall’s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break, without making it amount to a great deal.

Lyle (centre) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes . One neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high. Another powerful swipe was blocked by Andy Dowie’s head – at the expense of ringing ears. Queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell, but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack. Daniel Carmichael swept play wide to Lewis Kidd who took on Wallace. The Ibrox left-back toppled, apparently looking for a foul that wasn’t there, allowing Kidd to break into the penalty area. His cut-back found Lyle, who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right. The home fans roared approval, barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled. Lyle set up Reilly and his daisy-cutter drew a fine stop from Lee Robinson at full stretch. The QOTS striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1-0 in the first half . Play continues as a flare is let off in the Rangers section of the crowd at Palmerston Park . QOTS goalkeeper Zander Clark ensures Rangers' Bilel Mohsni does not find the back of the net . Rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour. Nicky Clark was close with a brave effort from a Darren McGregor cross, which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the Queens goal. Then, after a Haris Vuckic corner caused uncertainty, Kenny Miller sent a looping header against the bar. The first half duly closed with a penalty shout from Wallace after he tangled with Mark Durnan. Referee Don Robertson remained unmoved. Far worse followed for Wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side’s second concession of the evening. Kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from Rangers Lee Wallace immediately after the break . QOTS's Gavin Reilly (left) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3-0 to the good . Ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as Reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box. It reached Kidd beyond the far post, who angled a drive back towards goal. Off balance, Wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel. Rangers were rocking. They looked shaken by the energy of their hosts. Fowler’s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area. Templeton collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past Durnan, but creating clear chances remained a trickier task. Not long after, the winger was replaced by Robbie Crawford. Clark saw a deflected effort held, before a Mohnsi effort from distance was shuttled round the post. Yet there still wasn’t a convincing edge to these attacking forays. The fluidity witnessed against Hearts at the weekend had disappeared. Scott Hooper applauds the home support as he leaves the field followed by dejected Rangers players . Queens were now content to try and pick Rangers off when they could. And they notched their clinching third goal after 69 minutes. Holt nicked possession away from Crawford and worked a little exchange that released Reilly. The flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond Robinson. Rangers attempted a pride-saving late flurry but found Clark in excellent form in the home goal. Notable saves from Vuckic and substitute Kris Boyd ensured McCall’s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation.\n",

            "England have finally arrived home from Turin after their delayed flight landed at Manchester Airport following Tuesday night's 1-1 draw with Italy. The squad had originally been set to leave northern Italy immediately after the game but a technical issue with their plane made it necessary for Roy Hodgson's men to take an extra night's stay.

            "Attack: Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery to look like Joey Essex, was egged on Easter Monday (pictured) 'Britain's vainest man' who had taxpayer-funded plastic surgery  to look like reality star Joey Essex said today he is being bullied online by a gang who have now  thrown eggs in his face. Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery  - including two operations on the NHS - believes the culprits tracked him down using his Facebook posts and then attacked him in the street. The 22-year-old says abuse online about his appearance also forced him to move house. On Easter Monday he was attacked by a group of men who pelted him with eggs from a car. Sam had been enjoying a drink in the Green House pub in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, when a group of men shouted abuse at him as he left. The yobs then hurled six eggs at him before speeding off - leaving him with yolk and shell running down his face on the pavement. Sam said he believed he had been targeted because he had 'checked in' at the pub on Facebook minutes earlier. He said: 'It was quite a shock at first. I had just left the pub with two friends when I was suddenly pelted in eggs. 'There was shell in my hair and yolk dripping down my face. 'They shouted my name and swore at me as they drove past and threw eggs at me. 'They clearly didn't like me. It was not the kind of egg I was hoping to receive over the Easter holiday but after the shock had worn off I did have a laugh about it.' Scroll down for video . Sam had been taking part in filming with Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison on Saturday April 4 - just two days before he was attacked. Spending: Barton has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS . Pursuit of celebrity: Sam Barton has gone bankrupt financing plastic surgery and a champagne lifestyle to match his TOWIE heroes Joey Essex, together left, and Harry Derbidge, right . The pair spent the day being pampered at a beauty salon and then enjoying drinks in Birmingham for a reality show which will be aired on MTV. Debts: Barton admits he had debts of £100,000 on 15 credit cards and store cards trying to make it as a celeb . He also recently appeared on popular ITV show Judge Rinder to resolve a wrangle with a lapdancer friend over a Botox treatment row. Sam, who has spent £55,000 on perfecting his look, revealed in January he was going bankrupt after racking up debts of £35,000 on his Champagne lifestyle. Sam is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton and is best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee. Fame-hungry Sam previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man.' And he has amassed credit card debts of £25,000 in four years in search of the Joey Essex look that he hopes will make him a star. He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS. He admitted spending an astonishing £100,000 in just four years, blowing up to £2,000 a night on £300 bottles of expensive fizz. Sam, who lives with mum Jackie, dad Chris and brother Ed in Sutton Coldfield, plunged into the red after spending a fortune on plastic surgery. He added: 'I've spent around £55,000 trying to improve my looks and get the perfect image. 'The rest I've spent on designer clothes, jewellery, holidays, spa treatment and champagne. 'In total, I have spent around £100,000. At one point I counted 15 credit cards and store cards. 'I really do not regret it, I have had the time of my life over the last few years. 'My manager says this bankruptcy thing will clear my debts, so it's basically free money isn't it?' Sam, who is best pals with Benefits Street's White Dee, is now setting his sights on a place in the Big Brother house this summer.\n",

            "A woman who already has four children is set to become a mother of seven after falling pregnant with triplets. Nadine Crooks, 33, who lives in Smethwick, West Midlands, was stunned to discover she was expecting again as doctors told her she was infertile after she had her fourth child. She stopped taking contraceptives after learning she had polycystic ovary syndrome following the birth of her son Joshua 18 months ago. Set to become seven siblings: Nadine Crooks who is expecting triplets pictured with her four children, from left, Trae (13), Roxanne (18), Zion (9) and Joshua (1) The 33-year-old was stunned to fall pregnant again after being told she was infertile . Doctors said she would never be able to conceive naturally again after cysts were found on both her swollen ovaries. She stopped taking the Pill and was stunned when she fell pregnant for a fifth time last November. She said: 'I was shocked when I found out I was pregnant. When they told me I was going to have three, I couldn't believe it at all. 'They had told me I had polycystic ovaries shortly after Joshua was born. 'I decided to stop taking contraceptives and thought that was that. I was content with my four children so the idea of almost doubling my family has taken some getting used to.' Nadine was told polycystic ovary syndrome would prevent her becoming pregnant again following the birth of her fourth child, Joshua, pictured . Nadine has been told she is now expecting two boys and a girl with her 35-year-old partner, who did not want to be named. The triplets will be siblings to Roxanne, 18, Trae, 13, and Zion, nine, and Joshua, 18 months. The mother, who was born in Jamaica, said: 'I thought I was finished with babies. It is incredible.' She found out she was expecting triplets, who are due in July, at her 12-week scan at Birmingham Women's Hospital. 'I'm thrilled about it now but at the time I thought it must be some kind of joke. I knew I was pregnant though because I obviously know the signs by now,' Nadine said. 'I have no history of twins or triplets in my family and neither does my partner but we feel blessed to be having more children.' Nadine with her four children said they are all amazed that she's set to have three more . Her unplanned pregnancy meant she had to give up a college course in hairdressing so she can remain a full-time mother. 'I had planned to go to college but then I found I was pregnant. I wanted to further my career. I had been a hairdresser for some time but wanted to take the hairdressing course at college. 'So it has had an effect on my career. I really wanted to carry on working but had to stop,' she explained. The mother-of-four admits her whole family were amazed when she announced she would be adding another three to her brood. The expectant mother had been due to start a course in hairdressing but her career plans are now on hold . Nadine's scans, pictured left and right, have revealed she is expecting two boys and a girl due in July . She said: 'My family were shocked but I am only coming to terms with it now myself. My mum was not very happy. She thought four children was enough. 'When their father found out, he put his head in hands. He was quite shocked. 'I used to watch these programmes on TV about people with triplets and quadruplets and think I couldn't cope with that but I've got lots of family to help me when they arrive.' Nadine's pregnancy has also baffled doctors. She said: 'After the babies are born they are going to have a look to see what is going on. They will do some tests. I don't have a clue what has happened. I just don't know.'\n",

            "John Carver has labelled Moussa Sissoko's reckless lunge on Lucas as 'indefensible' as the Newcastle boss refused to make excuses for his captain. The midfielder was sent off for two bookings in the 2-0 defeat at Liverpool Sunday night, but he could've seen a straight red after he caught Lucas on the ankle. The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Moussa Sissoko lunges in and makes a terrible tackle on Liverpool midfielder Lucas . The 25-year-old was sent off for a second bookable offence during Newcastle's defeat at Anfield . Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, pulling no punches. He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' Lucas goes down in pain after Sissoko's nasty challenge at Anfield on Monday night . Newcastle manager John Carver labelled Sissoko's tackle as 'indefensible' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. Sissoko is given his marching orders by referee Lee Mason after picking up two yellow cards . He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'\n",

Transport for London has launched a campaign to tackle abuse on public transport, with a video in which a female commuter is groped while on the Tube.

Unsettling: Transport for London has launched a new campaign to tackle sexual assault on public transport, with a video in which a female commuter is groped on The Underground . Every time the man steps up his creepy efforts, the narrator - Broadchurch actress Olivia Coleman - asks: 'Would you report it?' After the man, who is clearly wearing a wedding ring, gropes his victim, she moves to a separate part of the carriage, only for him to shuffle up behind her. 'He pushes his groin right into you,' the narrator says. 'Would you report it?' According to TLC, one in ten Londoners have experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on public transport, but 90 per cent of these incidents go unreported.
